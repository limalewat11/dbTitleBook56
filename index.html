With just one city to depict, Homberger explores the rich variety of details in the city's 400-year history with vivid drawings and illustrations as well as beautifully rendered maps. The atlas takes on the geologic history of New York, major eras (Indian, Dutch, and British), and the formative 19th century, as well as the consolidation of Greater New York, neighborhood histories of Coney Island and Greenwich Village, and the Big Apple exploits of 1945 through 1996. But there's room for the small stuff, too, such as the political and cultural role of New York's taverns in the late 1700s. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i>Eric Homberger received his doctorate in American studies from Cambridge University and is reader in American studies at the University of East Anglia.

Now this master of mystery fiction takes us into the capital&#x2019;s chaotic fourth estate. At the big, aggressive newspaper The Washington Tribune, a young woman has been murdered. And the hunt for her killer is making sensational and lethal headlines.<b><br><br></b>The victim, fresh out of journalism school, hoped to make a splash at the Trib&#x2013;and then a maintenance man found her in a supply closet, brutally strangled to death. The Trib&#x2019;s journalists are at once horrified and anxious to solve the crime before the cops do, and put this scandal to rest. But the Metropolitan Police Department isn&#x2019;t going to let byline-hungry reporters get in the way of its investigation, and soon enough the journalists ad the cops have established warring task forces. Then a second woman is killed, in Franklin Square. Like the first, she was young, attractive, and worked in the media.<br><br>For veteran Trib reporter Joe Wilcox, whose career is mired in frustration and disappointment, the case strikes close to home. His daughter is a beautiful rising TV-news star. As his relationship with a female MPD detective grows more intimate, Joe sees a chance to renew himself as a reporter and as a man. Spearheading the Trib&#x2019;s investigation, he baits a trap with a secret from his own past.<br><br>Suddenly Joe is risking his career, his marriage, and even his daughter&#x2019;s life by playing a dangerous game with a possible serial killer, while a police detective is bending rules for the reporter she likes and trusts but may not know as well as she thinks she does. As Joe&#x2019;s daughter finds herself trapped at the heart of a frantic manhunt, the walls come down between family, friendship, ethics, and ambition&#x2013;and a killer hides in plain sight.<br><br>Chilling, riveting, and richly rewarding, Murder at The Washington Tribune is a brilliant tale of real people in a world where law, power, and honesty collide&#x2013;and where the punishment only sometimes fits the crime.</p><p>Margaret Truman<b> </b>has won faithful readers with her works of biography and fiction, particularly her ongoing series of Capital Crimes mysteries. Her novels let us into the corridors of power and privilege, and poverty and pageantry, in the nation&#x2019;s capital. She is the author of many nonfiction books, most recently The President&#x2019;s House, in which she shares some of the secrets and history of the White House where she once resided. She lives in Manhattan.Another speaker came to the podium. Joe Wilcox leaned close to his wife and muttered just loud enough for her pretty ears only, &#x201c;Another speaker.&#x201d; He shifted position in his chair and twisted his neck against a growing stiffness and full-blown boredom. With them at a front table were three couples, others from The Washington Tribune and their spouses who&#x2019;d agreed to attend the awards evening with the Wilcoxes out of friendship, or obligation, or maybe a little of both.<br><br> The dinner was an annual event for the Washington Media Association, whose members came from the ranks of Washington, D.C.&#x2019;s, print and broadcast journalists. Like most such groups, its leadership was fond of bestowing awards on deserving members and on their chosen profession, giving that same leadership a reason for taking to the podium to express their views on many things, mostly political. An occasional, usually accidental, bit of humor provided blessed audience relief from those who spoke endlessly, others longer.<br><br> At least they&#x2019;re getting to the awards, Wilcox thought as the speaker said &#x201c;In conclusion&#x201d; for the third time. Wilcox looked to a table at which his daughter, Roberta, sat. She was the reason Joe and Georgia were there.<br><br> The speaker at the podium finally did conclude, and the bestowing of awards commenced, twenty-two in all. Three weeks later&#x2014;or so it seemed&#x2014;Roberta was the sixteenth recipient called to the podium to accept the award for Best Local Investigative Reporting&#x2014;Broadcast, accompanied by the producer and the director of a TV series they&#x2019;d done on corruption within the Washington MPD.<br><br> &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t she look beautiful?&#x201d; Georgia said.<br><br> &#x201c;Of course she does,&#x201d; Wilcox replied. &#x201c;Because she is.&#x201d;<br><br> Roberta Wilcox did look stunning that evening in a stylish pantsuit the color of ripe peaches. But it was radiance from within that created a virtual aura around her, enhanced by a bright smile that had lit up the nightly news since she&#x2019;d joined the station three years earlier. &#x201c;The best-looking newscaster in D.C.&#x201d; was the consensus. She usually wore her auburn hair pulled back when on the air, but this evening she&#x2019;d let it down, framing an oval face with inquisitive raisin-brown eyes, her skin fair but not pale, her makeup tastefully underapplied. She thanked the station for having given her the freedom and support to pursue the expos�, read helpful names from a slip of paper including the producer and director, and ended by crediting her parents for having instilled in her the natural curiosity necessary to get the job done. &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;I come from good reportorial stock. My father is as good a reporter as there is in this city.&#x201d; She watched him wince, tossed him a kiss off her fingertips, and led her fellow award winners back to their table.<br><br> It was announced from the podium that the evening had come to an end, and most of the three hundred men and women left their tables to mingle, gravitating to familiar faces and offering congratulations to the winners, and to their families.<br><br> &#x201c;How&#x2019;d an ugly guy like you end up with such a knockout of a daughter?&#x201d; a Trib reporter asked Wilcox, accompanied by a laugh and a slap on the back.<br><br> &#x201c;Her mother&#x2019;s genes,&#x201d; Wilcox replied, nodding in the direction of his wife, who&#x2019;d gone to Roberta&#x2019;s table to talk with her and her celebrating tablemates.<br><br> &#x201c;Must be,&#x201d; Wilcox&#x2019;s friend said. He lowered his voice. &#x201c;What do you think of Hawthorne getting an award?&#x201d; Gene Hawthorne, a Trib Metro reporter, had been cited for a three-part series he&#x2019;d done on a local bank&#x2019;s illegal payoffs to a district official.<br><br> Wilcox shrugged, which accurately reflected what he was thinking. Hawthorne, in his late twenties, did not rank high on his list of favorite people. Wilcox wasn&#x2019;t alone in his negative view of the abrasive, aggressive young reporter who had a penchant for rubbing colleagues the wrong way, his knife always in search of an unprotected back, it seemed, and there were few toes fast enough to avoid being stepped on. Equally galling was the backing he received from the Trib&#x2019;s ranking editors and management, who obviously viewed the young, smug, sandy-haired, self-possessed reporter as a rising star, which, of course, he was, a bit of news that wasn&#x2019;t lost on anyone at the Trib, Joe included.<br><br> He saw in the young reporter something of himself years ago when he&#x2019;d come to The Washington Tribune, brimming with ambition and possessing the energy to fuel it. But it had been different at the paper twenty-three years ago. Then, there were still plenty of grizzled veteran reporters from whom to learn, men (almost exclusively) who lived the life of a reporter as portrayed in movies and plays, characters straight out of The Front Page, their heads surrounded by blue cigarette and cigar smoke, pints of whiskey in their desk drawers, the rattle and clank of their typewriters testifying to their daily output, spoken words tough and profane, written words sharp and to the point. There weren&#x2019;t many of them left. The younger Trib reporters, including Wilcox, had been hired to supplement that veteran staff. But eventually Gene Hawthorne and dozens of men and women like him had been brought in to replace the over-fifty crowd. There had been a flurry of buyouts offered over the past few years, and many newsroom veterans had jumped at the severance package with its generous cash settlement, pension options, and health and life insurance. In came the new blood, working at half the pay of the reporters who&#x2019;d gone on to their retirement, or in many cases new jobs. One of the Trib&#x2019;s top economics reporters had left on a Friday; his byline appeared over an article in the Trib the following Monday, written for a wire service that had eagerly hired him.<br><br> It just wasn&#x2019;t the same anymore for Joe Wilcox. He was now a member of the dinosaur club himself and was viewed with a certain barely disguised scorn by Hawthorne and his cadre of young hotshots. Joe was two years from fifty-five, the buyout age, with the lapel pin certifying that he&#x2019;d given The Washington Tribune the best twenty-five years of his life.<br><br> Roberta and Georgia approached and Roberta gave him a hug. She was taller than her father.<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks for the plug,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> &#x201c;I meant it,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> &#x201c;You look great, honey. Congratulations. That was a hell of a piece you did.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I wonder if anyone at MPD will ever congratulate me,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> Wilcox laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure the police are preparing a proclamation as we speak naming you honorary cop of the year.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know it was awkward for you,&#x201d; Roberta said, her expression as serious as her words.<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll get over it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I still have friends over there who agreed with you. They all suffer when a few foul balls taint the entire force.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But if they knew you&#x2019;d fed me some of the information I used&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Which they won&#x2019;t. Don&#x2019;t give it another thought, sweetie.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Anything new on Kaporis?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br> His response was a shake of his head, and a tiny smile for a thought that came and went. This daughter-journalist had not asked the question out of natural curiosity.<br> -<br><br> Like her father, Roberta Wilcox had been reporting on the killing of Jean Kaporis, a young woman who&#x2019;d joined The Trib less than a year ago, fresh out of the University of Missouri&#x2019;s school of journalism. Kaporis had been assigned to the paper&#x2019;s &#x201c;Panache&#x201d; section, helping cover the city&#x2019;s vibrant social scene: the weddings of those whose names were well known enough to justify coverage, fundraisers&#x2014;a day didn&#x2019;t pass in Washington when someone wasn&#x2019;t raising funds for something deemed worthy of their time and effort, important or whimsical&#x2014;and ideally a scandal among the rich and famous and thin, a political faux pas, a fatuous misstep that would leave readers tittering. It wasn&#x2019;t the sort of assignment she preferred, but she knew it represented a starting point for many newly hired female reporters, and she threw herself into it, hoping her work would capture the attention of someone in a position to move her into hard news.<br><br> That kind of break hadn&#x2019;t happened during her time at The Trib. But she had one advantage. She was lovely. Male heads turned and pulse rates sped up whenever she sauntered through the newsroom wearing skirts, sweaters, and blouses that accented her ripe body, donning a linen blazer in summer now and then as a nod to corporate correctness. No doubt about it, Jean Kaporis was a splendid example of young womanhood, every curve and bump properly placed, good genes in ample evidence, and especially a pleasant, willing personality to go with it, all of which attracted many people to her&#x2014;including whoever had strangled her to death.<br><br> A maintenance man found her early one morning a month ago in a secluded second-floor supply closet at the far end of the main newsroom, bruises on her neck, pretty mouth going in the wrong direction as though someone had removed it and carelessly pasted it back on. The autopsy reported that she&#x2019;d died from manual strangulation, her throat and larynx damaged from pressure exerted by her assailant&#x2019;s hands and fingers. The presence of petechial hemorrhages in the mucous membrane lining the inner surface of her eyelids provided presumptive evidence of strangulation. She&#x2019;d bitten her ...</p><h2>A Pelican in the Wilderness: Hermits and Solitaries</h2><p>In a series of essays, an acclaimed novelist delves deeply into the spiritual life, reflecting on ascetism in the works of Lao Tzu, the Desert Fathers, Wordsworth, Thoreau, and others. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>From St. Anthony to J.D. Salinger, hermits and recluses have helped the rest of us learn how to live in the bustle of the world. That paradox is the subject of <i>A Pelican in the Wilderness</i>, a sprawling exploration of solitariness by the novelist Isabel Colegate. The book contains a dazzling array of anecdotes and quotations drawn from sources including Howard Hughes, Lao Tzu, and Henry David Thoreau. Colegate's Merchant-Ivory prose gets a bit thick at times ("Autumn is a good time to see the gardens at Stourhead in Wiltshire"), a rankling reminder that willed exile is often made possible by economic privilege. But it's a great pleasure to ramble with the author through varied wisdom about a place that exists in everyone's heart, the small strip of territory between solitude and loneliness where peace is easily found, and easily lost. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Isabel Colegate is the author of thirteen previous books, including, most recently, <i>Winter Journey</i> (Counterpoint 2001). She lives near Bath, England.</p><h2>Hutterites in North America (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology)</h2><p>This case study in cultural anthropology focuses on the day-to-day living patterns of the Hutterites, a German-dialect-speaking Christian sect whose members live communally in the Great Plains of the United States and Canada. The authors describe the Hutterite belief system and how it minimizes aggression and dissension, and protects the members against the outside world. Features: * Hutterites&#39; core social and personal values - nonaggression, selflessness and humility - are a challenge to the central North American mainstream values of achivevement, exploitation and aggression. * Hutterite education of their young, a primary concern of all Hutterite colonies, is an example of how successful education maintains community. * The Hutterites have lived with prejudice since their beginnings four and one half centuries ago, and young Hutterite men who refused military service in North America were persecuted inhumanely as recently as World War I. * John Hostetler, of Old Order Amish parents and an internationally known expert on communal societies in the United States and Canada, was readily accepted by the closeknit Hutterite community, and Gertrude Huntington was accepted by the colony with which she and her family lived as they conformed to Hutterite norms.</p><p></p><h2>Out of Sheer Rage : Wrestling With D.H. Lawrence</h2><p>Recounts the author&#39;s experiences visiting the places D.H. Lawrence lived while actively not working on a book about Lawrence and not writing his own novel</p><p><i>Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling with D.H. Lawrence</i> is the best book about not writing a book about D.H Lawrence ever written. Other people have written untraditional, even loopy tributes to the priest of love before--including boon companions Anais Nin and Henry Miller--but no one has done it with Dyer's chutzpah, or with such fantastic success.<p> Dyer started out with the intention of writing either a sober academic study of Lawrence or a novel based on his subject's life but couldn't seem to do either. The academic study, he realized, was really just an excuse to read Lawrence's work, and the novel never even acquired a rudimentary shape in his mind. Instead, he somehow convinced his publisher to pick up the tab for his lengthy globetrotting pilgrimage, which took him from Paris to Rome to Greece to Oxford--not to mention such Lawrentian hotspots as Taos and Mexico and San Francisco. The result is an extended, often hilarious, meditation on seafood, English TV, Dyer's own creative impulses, and occasionally even Lawrence.</p><p> In Lawrence's seminal prose he finds some justification for his own capricious indulgences: "What Lawrence's life demonstrates so powerfully is that it actually takes a daily effort to be free.... There are intervals of repose but there will never come a state of definitive rest where you can give up because you have turned freedom into a permanent condition. Freedom is always precarious." Yet he refuses to read Lawrence's novels, confining himself to letters, travel reportage, and other casuals. Indeed, "[o]ne gets so weary watching authors' sensations and thoughts get novelised, set into the concrete of fiction, that perhaps it is best to avoid the novel as a medium of expression."</p><p> Dyer's fascination with Lawrence's minorabilia suggests not only an oblique criticism of the contemporary novel, but a promising direction for the memoir. Perhaps clean, well-lighted subjectivity is a dead end, and the future lies with eccentric, provisional works along the lines of <i>Flaubert's Parrot</i> and <i>How Proust Can Change Your Life</i>--or <i>Out of Sheer Rage</i>. After all, Dyer's bright (and brilliantly shambolic) book of life reminds us of why we read in the first place: to see the surprising ways one person can be brought to life by another. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><b>'The funniest book I have ever read' Steve Martin</b></p><h2>Residential Framing: A Homebuilder&#39;s Construction Guide</h2><p>&#x201c;Opens the subject to anyone...explores all the standard framing methods for floors, walls, ceilings, and roofs... demystifies some of the more obscure tasks, such as building gable dormers, multiple-pitched roofs, staircase construction, and structural foundations.

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, <i>Urusei Yatsura</i>, was serialized in <i>Weekly Shonen Sunday</i>. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--<b><i>Maison Ikkoku</i></b> ran from 1980 to 1987, <b><i>Ranma</i></b> <b><i>1/2</i></b> from 1987 to 1996, and <b><i>Inuyasha</i></b> from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include <b><i>Mermaid Saga</i></b>, <i><b>Rumic Theater</b></i>, and <b><i>One-Pound Gospel</i></b>.</p><h2>The Little Black Classics Dhammapada (Penguin Little Black Classics)</h2><p>&#39;Hate is not conquered by hate: hate is conquered by love.

A two-time Academy Award winner, he appeared in dozens of memorable films, including such classics as <i>Some Like It Hot, Mister Roberts, The Odd Couple, Grumpy Old Men, Missing, The Apartment,</i> and <i>The China Syndrome</i>. On-screen, he came across as a kind of "everyman"&#x2014;audiences loved him because they felt they knew him, because he was on of them.<br><br> In <i>A Twist of Lemmon</i>, Chris Lemmon shares family tales, intimate father-son conversations, and anecdotes from and about his dad. The result is a vivid and enchanting portrait of a less-than-perfect father who in some ways assumed a greater reality for his fans than he did for his son. Chris writes about the difficulty of growing up in a broken home, the treasured time spent with his father, and the friendship that evolved as they came to share their passions for both music and golf. This very personal portrait provides new insight into a man who charmed millions with his rascal's smile and his very human vulnerability.<br><br> When Jack Lemmon died in 2001, the world lost one of its favorite actors, but Chris Lemmon lost the man he had admired above all others. <i>A Twist of Lemmon</i> is his warm and moving and often very funny celebration of his larger-than-life father. <br><br> Joining Chris in his tribute are a number of the people who worked with Jack Lemmon over thy years, including actor Kevin Spacey. In his foreword, Spacey writes, "He was a credit to his profession because he was a man whose humanity was bigger than his talent. And when you think for a moment about the size and depth of that talent, then you begin to understand how seriously he took his role as a human being."<br><br> In this first book of its kind written about Jack Lemmon, that "human being" comes fully alive&#x2014;as an actor, a father, and a best friend. It is a heartwarming and discerning look at a true American legend.</p><p>Jack Lemmon was arguably one of the most famous film stars of the second half of the twentieth century. In dozens of memorable films, he created characters that millions of moviegoers cheered for and related to, and in the process became a kind of American &#x201c;everyman.&#x201d; The human qualities he demonstrated on-screen&#x2014;with all their complexity and conflict&#x2014;were part of his persona in real life as well.<br><br> Chris Lemmon&#x2019;s parents divorced when he was very young. Growing up, he knew his father primarily as someone who would visit his home to play with him and who later took him on yearly fishing trips to Alaska. As Chris matured, the bond between them deepened; they shared first their mutual love of music and then their passion for golf&#x2014;a game at which neither, alas, excelled.<br><br> When Jack Lemmon died in 2001, the world lost one of its favorite actors, but Chris Lemmon lost the man he had idolized above all others. In this tribute to his father&#x2014;as he knew him and loved him&#x2014;he shares the memories that he treasures most.CHRIS LEMMON is a writer and actor. He lives in Connecticut with his wife and three children. <i>A Twist of Lemmon</i> is his first book.</p><h2>Hypothyroidism, Health &amp; Happiness: The Riddle of Illness Revealed</h2><p>Have you ever thought to yourself, &#x201c;I think I might have a thyroid problem. &nbsp;I&#x2019;m tired all the time, no matter how much I exercise, I can&#x2019;t seem to lose weight, my hair&#x2019;s falling out, and overall I just feel blah.&#x201d;&nbsp; If so, it is essential that you explore the very real possibility that indeed, you do have hypothyroidism.&nbsp; In <i>Hypothyroidism, Health &amp; Happiness,</i> Dr. Steven Hotze reveals how commonly hypothyroidism is overlooked, misdiagnosed, and mistreated in women and men, and gives you just the information you need to prepare yourself to obtain help.<br> <br> Too often, individuals with all the signs of low thyroid are prevented from accessing the simple, inexpensive and effective treatment for hypothyroidism.&nbsp; Instead, they are told their blood work is &#x201c;normal.&#x201d;&nbsp; Find out why they owe it to themselves to believe what their bodies are telling them, rather than the results of their blood tests.<br> <br> Dr. Hotze has been on a mission to get this message into the hands of women and men, particularly those in midlife, for more than 20 years.&nbsp; The answers you will find in this book about the signs, symptoms and treatment of low thyroid conditions are no longer a part of the conventional medical approach to hypothyroidism.<br> Inside, you will learn:<br> <ul> <li> The historical basis for identifying and treating hypothyroidism</li> <li> Underlying causes of hypothyroidism</li> <li> Clinical signs and symptoms that may mean you have hypothyroidism</li> <li> The little-used thyroid blood test that identifies thyroid disorders in spite of a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; TSH</li> <li> Other individuals just like you who are now healthy, well, and thriving</li> <li> Simple at-home test you can do as a starting point towards discovering if you have low thyroid</li> <li> And more</li> </ul> Dr. Hotze has a saying, &#x201c;If you are sick and tired of being sick and tired, then you owe it to yourself to take charge of your health and get your life back.&#x201d; By arming yourself with the information in this book you can take the first step towards restoring your health, transforming your life and improving your world.</p><p>Steven F.

German and Hebrew translations are yet to be printed.</p><p>Norma Archbold, MA, former Director of Religious Education, served the Lord in Jerusalem and the West Bank where she researched and wrote The Mountains of Israel, provided free Bibles for Arabs, arranged for emergency aid to Christians, and fought for a high standard of truth in the media and for the release of new believers jailed and tortured by the PA.PREFACE <p>For everyone who loves the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the events unfolding in the Middle East are important. </p><p>It is difficult, however, to form a clear picture of what is happening. The news in the West about the Arab-Israeli conflict is incomplete and often inaccurate and is interpreted by people, who do not necessarily believe in the Bible, or have a clear overall picture of the 4,000-year-old conflict. </p><p>Without an overall picture of the conflict the events mentioned in the news are meaningless. Years of historical research is necessary to find the missing pieces. To match history with the Word of God one must also be a serious student of the Bible. </p><p>For many people understanding the Arab-Israeli conflict is so difficult that they have given up. </p><p>In studying the Middle East conflict I was struck by the similarity of Middle East events and chapters 35 and 36 of Ezekiel. </p><p>These chapters are two halves of a whole. Chapter 35 is a prophecy "against" a mountain (Mount Seir) and chapter 36 is a prophecy "to" mountains (the mountains of Israel). Mount Seir and the mountains of Israel are the homelands of twin brothers Esau and Jacob, ancestors of today's Arabs and Jews. </p><p>Although chapter 35 contains warnings and chapter 36 contains promises, the purpose is the same. Both chapters end with the same words, "Then they shall know that I am the Lord." </p><p>By revealing the similarity between these chapters and historical and current events The Mountains of Israel provides a context for the bits and pieces we pick up in the news. </p><p>The Bible has much to say about the Arab-Israeli conflict. But without knowing the identity of Edom and the location of Mount Seir and of the mountains of Israel, one can read right past some startling information without understanding that it affects the Middle East, the world and important decisions being made today. </p><p>The Mountains of Israel provides important missing pieces which point out the truth of the Bible, revealing God's great power, wisdom, and faithfulness. </p><p>This is not a chatty book. I use just enough words to help you to see the picture without getting lost in complicated side issues. Simple maps and other illustrations make a point with few words. </p><p>To help you to feel the desolation of Israel before the return of the Jewish people, I have included quotes from eyewitnesses&#x2014;Gentiles who traveled here in the 18th and 19th centuries. You will see that Israel was a treeless, barren wasteland. </p><p>The population a century and a half ago was less than 4% of today's population. As you read the eyewitness reports, imagine what Israel must have been like without 96% of its population. </p><p>In the19th century those who visited the Holy Land testified of its condition. "A desolate country," "wretched desolation and neglect," "almost abandoned now," "unoccupied," "uninhabited," "Thinly populated" is how they described the land. </p><p>The Reverend Samuel Manning said about the coastal plain, "This fertile plain, which might support an immense population, is almost a solitude...Day by day we were to learn afresh the lesson now forced upon us, that the denunciations of ancient prophecy have been fulfilled to the very letter&#x2014;'the land is left void and desolate and without inhabitants.'" </p><p>Jews were among the sparse population&#x2014;as prophesied more than 2,500 years ago. "...the forsaken places are many in the ...Land...but yet a tenth will be in it...as an oak whose stump remains when it is cut down so the holy seed shall be its stump." (Isaiah 6:12-13) </p><p>An official report in 1864 reveals that the largest group living in Jerusalem was Jewish. </p><p>God is keeping his promise to bring the children of Israel back to their land. Jewish people have been returning to Israel for more than 120 years. For a glimpse inside their hearts I have included the story of an Ethiopian girl, who walked through a desert, to fulfill her desire to be in Jerusalem. </p><p>What is happening today was foreseen and is working out according to the promises of God. </p><p>When the Bible and the events in the Middle East are understood one cannot reasonably deny the existence of God. Properly understood, the events of today are earth shaking. </p><p>I took information from many sources and named them so you can study the subject as thoroughly as you wish. Bible references are given. The authority for this work rests firmly on the Bible&#x2014;the Word of the Lord. </p><p>Those who do not accept God's Word will not accept the conclusions in The Mountains of Israel. But those who do accept the Bible as God's Word and who love Him, will find reason to rejoice. The Lord is keeping His promises in our day, proving that the Bible is true. </p><p>If you are one of the small group who have a good basic understanding of the Middle East situation, you already know how difficult it is to explain to others. The Mountains of Israel can give your family and friends the overview they need to understand the issues. Teachers and others who speak about the Arab-Israeli situation will find this book helpful.

It was written in 1486 by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger, and was first published in Germany in 1487. It was the culmination of a long medieval tradition of treatises on witchcraft, the most famous being the Formicarius by Johannes Nider in 1435-1437. The main purpose of the Malleus was to systematically refute all arguments against the reality of witchcraft, refute those who expressed even the slightest skepticism about its reality, to prove that witches were more often women than men, and to educate magistrates on the procedures that could find them out and convict them. <i>(Quote from wikipedia.org)</i><br><br><b>About the Author</b><br><br>Heinrich Kramer (1430 - 1505)<br>James Sprenger (1436 - 1494)<br>Heinrich Kramer (also known under Latinised name Heinrich Institoris, c. 1430 - 1505) was a German churchman and inquisitor.<br><br>Born in Schlettstadt, Alsace, he joined the Dominican Order at an early age and while still a young man was appointed Prior of the Dominican house of his native town.<br><br>At some date before 1474 he was appointed Inquisitor for the Tyrol, Salzburg, Bohemia and Moravia.

Born in S�lestat, Alsace, he joined the Dominican Order at an early age and while still a young man was appointed Prior of the Dominican house of his native town. At some date before 1474 he was appointed Inquisitor for the Tyrol, Salzburg, Bohemia and Moravia. His eloquence in the pulpit and tireless activity received recognition at Rome and he was the right-hand man of the Archbishop of Salzburg. By the time of the Bull Summis desiderantes of Pope Innocent VIII in 1484 he was already associated with Jacob Sprenger to make an inquisition for witches and sorcerers. In 1485 he drew up a treatise on witchcraft which was incorporated in the Malleus Maleficarum (literally &#34;The hammer of malefactresses (wrongdoing women - i.e. witches)&#34;). Kramer failed in his attempt to obtain endorsement for this work from the top theologians of the Inquisition at the Faculty of Cologne, and they condemned the book as recommending unethical and illegal procedures, as well as being inconsistent with Catholic doctrines of demonology. Kramer&#39;s claimed endorsement from four of the professors may have been forged. He was denounced by the Inquisition in 1490. In 1495 he was summoned to Venice to give public lectures, which were very popular. In 1500 he was empowered to proceed against the Waldensians and Picards. He died in Bohemia in 1505.</p><h2>Halo: Evolutions Volume II: Essential Tales of the Halo Universe</h2><p><p>The original Halo: Evolutions, split into two volumes.

When the alien juggernaut known as the Covenant declared holy war upon the fragile human empire, millions of lives were lost-but, millions of heroes rose to the challenge. In such a far-reaching conflict, not many of the stories of these heroes, both human and alien, have a chance to become legend.

All one had to do was look for the enormous pinkish-purple plume of energy spearing out of the horizon on the colony world Verge. They bled silently through ten square kilometers of heavily fortified enemy anti-aircraft positions toward the perpetually shining beam until at last they reached the remains of Ciudad de Arias.<br>This city had been among the hardest hit in the initial Covenant assault a few months prior. The buildings leaned and listed on their foundations like beaten boxers right before a climactic keel to the mat. It took Black-Four a few minutes to identify an apartment tower that looked stable enough for them to scale without it collapsing beneath their feet.<br>Once they reached the penthouse, they passed stencils of pandas and koalas still visible on the charred walls as they entered what they assumed had been a child&#x2019;s room. They lay down on their bellies and looked out through the vacant holes where windows once were.<br>Their massive target drifted about five blocks away, casually knocking over fire-gutted husks into clouds of rubble. Thanks to their untranslatable and unpronounceable Covenant name, FLEETCOM simply dubbed the enormous machines &#x201c;Beacons.&#x201d; Nearly fifty stories tall and five city blocks wide, the Beacon looked to the Spartans&#x2019; eyes like a perfectly symmetrical beehive floating atop four antigravity stilts. Out of its gaping lower orifice swarmed a buzzing cloud of Yanme&#x2019;e, the glittering, winged insectoids humans called Drones. Clicking and screeching and hissing and squealing in a teeth-gritting cacophony, the swarm tore deep below Verge&#x2019;s surface with handheld antigravity grapplers that yanked up great chunks of regolith. The Drones flew back up and deposited the rocks inside the Beacon&#x2019;s hollow, irradiant heart, where the helium-3 inside them would be extracted and converted into pure fusion power. The energy was then projected skyward, focused in the form of a massive purple beam erupting from the Beacon&#x2019;s summit. A weblike constellation of Covenant satellites orbiting Verge transmitted the power to the fleet blockading the colonies on Tribute, in the Epsilon Eridani system.<br>Like every other colony world&#x2019;s, Verge&#x2019;s helium-3 deposits had been trapped in the second mantle laid down over her original, natural exosphere during the spallation-heavy terraforming process. The Beacon would drift from continent to continent, gathering and extracting all the He-3 it could, until Verge was picked clean, a few weeks from now. Then the machine and its crew would be drawn up into a battle cruiser so the Covenant could glass the planet from space.<br>Unless, of course, Spartan: Black blew the godforsaken thing to kingdom come first, cutting off the primary fuel source to the fleet blockading Tribute and giving the colonists there a fighting chance.<br>Which was exactly what they planned to do.<br>&#x201c;What do we see, people?&#x201d; Black-One asked. Befitting their highly classified status as an unconventional warfare (UW) unit, Spartan: Black&#x2019;s ebony armor had been created as skunkwork prototypes in a top secret parallel development lab in Seongnam, United Korea; as such, MJOLNIR: Black boasted a few variant design elements and enhancements completely different from the standard-issue combat exoskeleton. Its HUD magnification, for example, was much greater than the standard Mark V or VI, with a field of view of nearly five thousand meters. From this distance, Spartan: Black could zoom in on the support troops milling beneath the antigrav &#x201c;feet&#x201d; of the Beacon and see them as clearly as if they had been standing across the street.<br>&#x201c;Two Hunters per pylon,&#x201d; Black-Two said, noting the stooped, spiny-armored behemoths. Each creature&#x2019;s right arm terminated in a gun barrel studded with luminescent green power rods. &#x201c;Armed with standard assault cannon.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Complemented by two&#x2014;no, three&#x2014;Jackals at each corner,&#x201d; Black-Three added.<br>The spiky-crowned, beaked aliens carried, in addition to plasma pistols holstered at their sides, some kind of long pole made of a translucent purple-pink crystalline material. Occasionally, a Drone would flit away from the larger swarm in a confused, almost drunken fashion, and a couple of Jackals would descend on it with a shriek, stabbing the stray in the neck, where it wore a translucent reddish-orange collar. The bugger quaked spasmodically with pain, clutching the collar with its front claws; it could take only a thrust or two from the Jackals and the resulting seizures before it fell dutifully back with the swarm and resumed whatever task it had abandoned.<br>&#x201c;Jackals aren&#x2019;t just security,&#x201d; Four said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re also management.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very nice to meet you,&#x201d; Two said. &#x201c;I look forward to killing you.&#x201d;<br>No one said anything for almost five minutes. They just watched the enemy work.<br>Finally, Three said, &#x201c;Hunters and Jackals&#x2014;they&#x2019;re just another day at the office. I mean, I can kill Tree-Turkeys in my sleep. And Can-o&#x2019;-Worms are something you can sink your teeth into. But the buggers&#x2014;how many are there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a hundred, a hundred fifty so far,&#x201d; Four said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not sure&nbsp;... some I may have counted twice. They&#x2019;re moving pretty fast down there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;One-fifty&nbsp;... Jesus,&#x201d; Three said. &#x201c;How are the buggers going to react when we bring the hammer down? Can they use those grappler things as weapons? What kind of intel do we have on their tactics and behavior?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We have jack,&#x201d; said Two, the fireteam&#x2019;s intelligence officer. &#x201c;Covenant&#x2019;s rarely deployed them as combatants.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; Three muttered again, shaking his head. &#x201c;I hate surprises.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If it was easy, they wouldn&#x2019;t call us heroes,&#x201d; One drawled.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d prefer a pat on the back,&#x201d; Three said. &#x201c;But I gotta be alive for that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Two,&#x201d; One said, &#x201c;find us a room in the interior where we can mull this over and catch some Z&#x2019;s without being seen from the street.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Copy that, Chief.&#x201d; Black-Two backed out on her stomach until she reached the nursery&#x2019;s doorway, then got up into a crouch and made her way quickly but cautiously through the rest of the penthouse. She determined that what was left of the kitchen had no good sightlines to the perimeter and prepared to return and tell One but was stopped by a fluttering, flapping sound from a doorway on the north side of the room.<br>She pressed her back against the wall and peered around the doorway. She was looking into a ruined family room, a flatscreen lying facedown and shattered on a carpet littered with tempered glass that once filled floor-to-ceiling windows. On the ground beside a sofa blackened and bloated by fire and the elements, a solitary Yanme&#x2019;e Drone twitched his wings spasmodically.<br>Two put both hands on the assault rifle hanging from her shoulder and silently lined up a shot at the crown of the bugger&#x2019;s walnut-shaped head. Something seemed off about the creature, though. She didn&#x2019;t pull the trigger.<br>Two realized the Drone was on his back, pulsing the hinged armored plates that covered his wings over and over again in a futile attempt to flip himself over onto his belly. Two could now see that all four of his lower legs had been cut off and cauterized at the stumps. His two remaining arms didn&#x2019;t have joints that allowed him to reach behind and push himself upright.<br>Two watched him struggle for twenty seconds more. Then she emerged from behind the doorway and took several slow strides over to where the Drone lay. His orange, half-egg eyes were fixed at the ceiling and didn&#x2019;t register her approach.<br>Still covering the insectoid with the rifle, Two tucked one foot under the creature&#x2019;s body and kicked him up and over. He began frantically beating his wings to stay upright while hopping up and down on the end of his abdomen. The bugger was human sized, and they were now practically eye to eye. Two took a step back and made sure the Drone was staring down the barrel of the AR.<br>Holding the gun steady with one hand, she flexed her other elbow in such a way that a compartment sprang open along the left forearm of the skunkware MJOLNIR. A wand computer with a microphone, speakers, a digital ink keyboard, and every scrap of linguistics data United Nations Space Command had gathered on the languages of Covenant races popped out of the compartment and slid into her palm.<br>&#x201c;Identify yourself and your purpose,&#x201d; Two said sternly, and waited for the Interrogator, as ONI had christened the device, to translate and broadcast the question in Yanme&#x2019;e.<br>The icon of a rotating circle appeared on the Interrogator&#x2019;s display, indicating it was working. After only a few seconds, the device emitted a faint series of clicks and screeches in a pitiful attempt to mimic Yanme&#x2019;e speech. Two had little faith in it succeeding. Sure enough, a moment later, its display flashed: &#x201c;Untranslatable.&#x201d; Two cursed under her breath. Not enough was known about the damn buggers to make even that simple demand intelligible.<br>With his head cocked quizzically, the Drone watched as Black-Two tried to rephrase the question a couple of different ways so that the Interrogator might translate, but no avail.<br>Then the creature made an unmistakable gesture, extending one claw in her direction, then curling his digits rapidly toward himself: <i>Give.</i><br>Black-Two frowned. What little intel ONI had on the Drones suggested they had an instinctive faculty for technology. Cautiously, she handed the Interrogator over. There seemed little harm in it. A cord attached the device to her forearm to supply it with power and data...</p><h2>The Collectibles Quilt</h2><p>In this book by the author of Houses of Cloth, Wendy steps inside her house and finds inspiration from the furniture within.

In this book, Henri Nouwen combines creative case studies of ministry with stories from diverse cultures and religious traditions in preparing a new model for ministry. Weaving keen cultural analysis with his psychological and religious insights, Nouwen has come up with a balanced and creative theology of service that begins with the realization of fundamental woundedness in human nature. Emphasizing that which is in humanity common to both minister and believer, this woundedness can serve as a source of strength and healing when counseling others. Nouwen proceeds to develop his approach to ministry with an analysis of sufferings -- a suffering world, a suffering generation, a suffering person, and a suffering minister. It is his contention that ministers are called to recognize the sufferings of their time in their own hearts and make that recognition the starting point of their service. For Nouwen, ministers must be willing to go beyond their professional role and leave themselves open as fellow human beings with the same wounds and suffering -- in the image of Christ. In other words, we heal from our own wounds. Filled with examples from everyday experience, <i>The Wounded Healer</i> is a thoughtful and insightful guide that will be welcomed by anyone engaged in the service of others.</p><p>For more information on the life and works of Henri J.M. Nouwen, please visit <i>HenriNouwen.org</i> .More than three decades have passed since this important work was first published in 1972.&nbsp; Its enduring popularity demonstrates how clearly Henri Nouwen sounds the chord that reveals ministry as an encounter and identification with those who wait for Good News.<br><br>While the earlier edition might have attracted mainly people in Church ministry, the present volume is a universal call for compassion within relationships, on our journey to becoming more fully human.<br><br><i>Sue Mosteller, C.S.J.<br><i>The Henri Nouwen Legacy Trust</i></i></p><h2>Daily in Christ: A Devotional</h2><p>A Daily Devotional for breaking free of the things that don&#39;t do us any good in our lives.</p><p><p><b>Dr. Neil T.

Original.</p><p><p><b>First Encounter</b> </p><p> You never forget the first man you kill. </p><p> Man. </p><p> Well...that may be an exaggeration. </p><p> I was fourteen seasons at the time, a youth on my homeworld of Xenex. My father had died several seasons before that, beaten to death in the public square by our Danteri oppressors as a signal to all my people that we should know our place. It is my everlasting shame that I did not immediately retaliate. Instead I stood there, paralyzed. I can still remember my older brother digging his fingers into my shoulder, keeping me from attacking. That was what I wanted to do at the time. I wanted to charge from the crowd, leap upon the man who was inflicting such punishment upon my father, and sink my teeth into his throat. I wanted to feel his blood fountaining between my teeth. </p><p> Unfortunately, I was a child. My brother was probably concerned -- not without reason -- that I would be cut down before I got within twenty feet of my father's tormentor. So I stayed where I was, and watched, and wished the entire time that I could tear my eyes from my sockets, block out the cries from my father's throat. </p><p> Such a proud man, he was. So proud. What they did to him... </p><p> It fueled me several years later when I began my campaign against the Danteri. </p><p> There was a tax collector, a rather hated Danteri individual named Stener. A short, squat individual, he was, with a voice like a rockslide and a viciousness in attitude and deportment that made you cringe as soon as you look at him. He rode about on this mount, a large and hairy creature called a Pok that had been specially bred by the Danteri to be a sort of all-purpose steed. He always had several guards with him. On this particular day, he had three. They were massively broad, although it was difficult to get a precise idea of their build beneath their armor. They were not wearing helmets, however, possibly because it was hot and the helmets were sweaty. Instead their helmets were tucked under their arms. That would prove to be a costly mistake. </p><p> It was a very hot day, I remember. Very hot, the last day of a very hot week. Tempers were becoming ragged as it was, and whispers of my rabble-rousing were already beginning to reach the ears of the Danteri. At that particular time, though, they dismissed me as nothing they need concern themselves about. I was, after all, merely a loudmouthed teenager insofar as they knew. Perhaps more erudite than many, but nothing much more than that. Still, they saw the growing anger in the eyes of my people. The downward casting of glances, the automatic subservience... that seemed to be present less and less, and it very likely concerned the Danteri. </p><p> I was determined to give them more than cause for concern. I wanted to send them an unmistakable message. To let them know that my people would not tolerate their presence on my world any longer. To let them know that their torture of my father -- rather than serving as a warning -- had instead awakened the slumbering giant of Xenexian pride. And I wanted my hand to be the one that struck the first blow, that hammered the gong which would chime out the call to freedom. </p><p> Stener had collected the taxes in my home city of Calhoun, but he had very likely tired of the epithets, the curses, the increasingly aggressive sneers that greeted him. Nothing actionable or worth starting a fight over, but it very likely grated on him. He didn't know that I was following him, stalking him. He can be forgiven for his obliviousness. There were any number of scruffy, disheveled Xenexian youths around, so there was no intrinsic reason for him to focus on me any more than on anyone else. I stuck to the shadows, skulked around buildings, and whenever any of his men happened to glance in my direction, I managed to melt into the background, to disappear. </p><p> To a certain extent...it was a game. I was in the throes of youth, pleased with my skill and alacrity. As I paced them, keeping to myself but never letting them from my view, I felt an increasing sense of empowerment. Even -- dare I say it -- invincibility. That is naturally a very dangerous state of mind. Under such circumstances, one can become exceedingly sloppy. One should never underestimate an opponent, and I do not for a moment recommend it for anyone. </p><p> They reached the outskirts of Calhoun and still had not spotted me. Had they then decided to return to their vessel and depart, they might very well all have survived. But they didn't. That was their greed, their own arrogance and sense of invincibility...as dangerous to them as to me. Stupidity is remarkably evenhanded. </p><p> Since they were certain that my people were too subservient to pose a serious threat, they decided to make their way to the neighboring, smaller village of Moute. Everything was happening spur-of-the-moment. Had I given the matter any thought at all, I would have gone into it with something approaching a plan. But I was flying on instinct alone, which was a habit that I would thankfully not continue to indulge in for my future dealings. </p><p> There was only one road between Calhoun and Moute, and I knew they were going to have to take it. Stener's Pok was moving at a fairly slow pace, and his three guards had to walk slowly to match it. As a result I had more than enough opportunity to get ahead of them. I moved with an almost bizarre recklessness, searching out and finding higher ground along the rocky ridges that lined the road. Ideally there would have been something with sufficient altitude that I could have sent an avalanche cascading down on their damned heads. Unfortunately the territory was fairly low, the ridges rising no more than maybe ten feet, so that wasn't an option. So I had to resort to other means to accomplish my task. I examined the stones beneath my feet and around me as I kept in careful pursuit, selecting those stones that best suited my purposes. The best were smooth and round, capable of hurtling at high speeds if thrown with enough strength. Believe me, the way I was feeling at that moment, my strength was more than sufficient. Such was the confidence I had in myself that I only selected three stones. It never even occurred to me that more might possibly be required. </p><p> I moved with speed and stealth, getting farther ahead until I was satisfied with the distance I'd put between myself and my targets. Crouching behind one of the upright outcroppings, I held one stone in either hand, and popped the third into my mouth for easy access. I listened carefully to determine if there was any useful information I could derive from whatever chitchat I might overhear, but there was no crosstalk at all. They rode in an almost eerie silence, as if they existed only to be my victims and otherwise had no lives up until that point. </p><p> The sun was beginning to descend upon the horizon, but it would still be quite some time until night. I had no interest in waiting until darkness. I wanted to see their faces clearly. I wanted them to know that even in broad daylight, there was still nowhere safe that they could hide. Besides, they'd be easier targets in the daylight. However, everything was going to depend upon my speed. </p><p> My back against the outcropping, I took a deep breath to steady my racing heart. I knew that the main thing I had going for me was the element of surprise. The moment that was lost, only pure speed could help me. I sprang from my hiding place and hurled the first rock, flipped the second rock to my throwing hand as I spit the third out. The first rock struck the closest guard squarely in the forehead. It knocked him cold. The second guard whirled around to see what had happened to his associate, but the second rock was already in flight and this one struck as accurately as the first. The third guard didn't even have a chance to turn; my last missile hit him bangon in the back of his head. He went down without a sound. </p><p> It had all happ</p></p><h2>Feast Day of Fools: A Novel (A Holland Family Novel)</h2><p>Sheriff Hackberry Holland patrols a small Southwest Texas border town with a deep and abiding respect for the citizens in his care. Still mourning the loss of his cherished wife and locked in a perilous almost-romance with his deputy, Pam Tibbs, a woman many decades his junior, Hackberry feeds off the deeds of evil men to keep his own demons at bay. <br><br>When alcoholic ex-boxer Danny Boy Lorca witnesses a man tortured to death in the desert and reports it, Hack&#x2019;s investigation leads to the home of Anton Ling, a regal, mysterious Chinese woman whom the locals refer to as La Magdalena and who is known for sheltering illegals. Ling denies having seen the victim or the perpetrators, but there is something in her steely demeanor and aristocratic beauty that compels Hackberry to return to her home again and again as the investigation unfolds. Could it be that the sheriff is so taken in by this creature who reminds him of his deceased wife that he would ignore the possibility that she is just as dangerous as the men she harbors? <br><br>The danger in the desert increases tenfold with the return of serial murderer Preacher Jack Collins, whom <i>The New York Times </i>called &#x201c;one of Burke&#x2019;s most inspired villains.&#x201d; Presumed dead at the close of <i>Rain Gods</i>, Preacher Jack has reemerged with a calm, single-minded zeal for killing that is more terrifying than the muzzle flash of his signature machine gun. But this time he and Sheriff Holland have a common enemy. <br><br>Praised by Joyce Carol Oates for &#x201c;the luminosity of his writerly voice,&#x201d; James Lee Burke returns with his most allegorical novel to date, illuminating vital issues of our time&#x2014;immigration, energy, religious freedom&#x2014;with the rich atmosphere and devastatingly flawed, authentic characters that readers have come to celebrate during the five decades of his brilliant career.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, September 2011</strong>: James Lee Burke&#x2019;s impressive body of work spans five decades and includes two Edgar Award-winning mysteries--yet his 30th book, <i>Feast Day of Fools</i>, may arguably be his best effort to date. In this sequel to his 2009 novel, <i>Rain Gods</i>, Burke returns to the hard-scrabble Texas town on the Mexican border, and its contemplative sheriff Hackberry Holland. Holland is a quintessential Burke hero&#x2014;deeply moral, tortured by past sins, appalled at the depravity of our fallen world, and firmly committed to justice. <i>Feast Day of Fools</i> opens with a horrific murder in the desert. One man is tortured and dismembered by a menacing psychopath named Krill. Another man, a government agent whom Krill kidnapped and planned to sell to Al Qaeda, escapes into the night. In its aftermath, Holland encounters a vibrant cast of characters&#x2014;including Anton Ling, an enigmatic woman whose home is a place of refuge to desperate immigrants, and the riveting Preacher Jack Collins, a terrifying serial killer, who had seemingly died at the end of <i>Rain Gods</i>. Packed with lush imagery and allegorical heft, <i>Feast Day of Fools</i> is a tightly wound thriller that reconfirms James Lee Burke&#x2019;s status as a master storyteller.--Shane Hansanuwat <br><br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Michael Connelly Reviews <em>Feast Day of Fools</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong>Michael Connelly is a former journalist and best-selling author of <em>The Scarecrow</em>, <em>The Fifth Witness</em>, <em>The Brass Verdict</em>, and <em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em></strong>. <br> <p> </p> <p>You know what is rare? A veteran and prodigious writer who never lets you down. Who, with each book, and I&#x2019;m talking about a lot of books, makes you feel like you have discovered something new, learned some hidden truth about human behavior and society. James Lee Burke is one of those rarities. Book to book he keeps it going, never disappointing. Last year's masterpiece is just prelude to this year's new masterpiece. </p> <p>It flat out astounds me. I can count the names of other writers in this category on one hand. There is no magic formula for this. It's something that comes from within, an indeterminate mixture of craft and wisdom and the relentless pursuit of perfection. It comes from knowing deep in the bones that life is about reconciliation and redemption. Burke's books carry these truths in spades.</p> <p>About twenty-five years ago I picked up a book called <em>The Neon Rain</em> in a bookstore simply because I liked the cover. I read the flaps and read the first page and went to the cash register. Soon I was into my first ride with James Lee Burke. </p> <p><em>The Neon Rain</em> was that year's masterpiece. This year, we have <em>Feast Day of Fools</em> and my survey of Burke books in between concludes that he remains the heavy weight champ, a great American novelist whose work, taken individually or as a whole, is unsurpassed.</p> <p>It is the writer's job to look out the window at the world and tell us how he sees it. In this book Burke puts the unblinking eye on the issues of politics and immigration and religion, synthesizing it all down to the character and impulse of violence and vengeance. At center, he gives us Hackberry Holland, a man who carries the past with him like the Texas sheriff's badge pinned to his chest. He gives us villains as treacherous as any ever put down on page. And he gives us prose as deeply etched and poetic as the landscape along the Texas-Mexico border. Here&#x2019;s just one little taste that I loved: "Hackberry realized that he was about to witness one of those moments when evil reveals itself for what it is-&#x2013;insane in its fury and self-hatred and its animus at whatever reminds it of itself."</p> <p>This is a story about the evil that men do. It is allegory. It is knowledge. As one of the characters says to the man who has witnessed his cruelty, "Maybe one day you will understand men like us."</p> <p>I think James Lee Burke does and this year's masterpiece takes us closer to the heart of the matter. It makes us look through the window and see the world in a new way. <em>--Michael Connelly</em></p>James Lee Burke is a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author, two-time winner of the Edgar Award, and the recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts in Fiction.

She lives in Raleigh, North Carolina.In this eighth book in the Judge Deborah Knott series (after 2000's Storm Track), Maron employs spare, straightforward prose and the languid language of the Carolina Piedmont to spin an exceptionally gripping tale of hate, jealousy and murder. Still smarting from the betrayal of her lover, Kidd Chapin, the redoubtable jurist travels to Randolph County, N.C., in order to settle the equitable distribution of the marital property of a pair of freshly divorced potters, Sandra Kay Nordan and James Lucas Nordan. Before she can finish her legal duties, however, somebody bakes James Lucas in a kiln. Deborah's own sense of loss in the wake of Kidd's rejection helps her empathize with patriarch Amos Nordan's multiple tragedies (another son died two years earlier) as well as a hired woman's grief over her retarded son. Amidst a beautifully evoked flowering spring countryside, Deborah pursues the murderer with her usual keen eye and common sense. If the book fairly swells with passion, a healthy dose of Southern humor keeps things from getting too maudlin. By the time the story reaches its dramatic conclusion, readers will be in mourning, wishing the end hadn't come so soon. Maron's mastery of jurisprudence, her well-researched depiction of the potting world but especially her sensitive portrayal of human relationships raise this novel far above the ordinary run of mysteries.

In the Sierra Nevadas to the east, the snow was piling up and would offer great skiing once the storm had passed.<br><br> In the foothills of the Sierras in the town of Grass Valley, California, the streets were flooded, and in some parts of town, the power was off where trees had blown down. At the small church, the heavy rain and high winds beat against the windows with a violence that Father O�Malley had never before heard. In his tiny bedroom, O�Malley was laboriously writing Sunday�s sermon by candlelight. Out of the darkness, the phone in his office rang, shattering his concentration. He picked up the candle, and with his hand cupped in front of it, ambled down the hall in a sphere of dim flickering light.<br><br> As he picked up the phone, a voice quickly asked, �Is this Father O�Malley?�<br> �Yes.�<br> �I�m calling from the hospital in Auburn,� said a concerned female voice. �We have a terminally ill patient who is asking us to get someone to give him his last rites. Can you come quickly?�<br> �I�ll try my best to make it,� O�Malley answered. �But the river is over its banks, and trees are blown down all over town. It�s the worst storm I�ve seen in all the years I�ve been here. Look for me within two hours.�<br><br> The trip was only 30 miles, but it would be hard going. The headlights on Father O�Malley�s 20-year-old car barely penetrated the slashing rain, and where the winding road crossed and recrossed the river in a series of small bridges, trees had blown down across the river�s banks. But for some reason, there was always just enough room for Father O�Malley to make his way around them. His progress was slow and cautious, but he continued on toward the hospital.<br><br> Not a single vehicle passed him during his long, tense journey. It was way past midnight, and anyone else out on a night like this would also have to be on an emergency mission.<br><br> Finally, in the near distance, the lights of the small hospital served as a beacon to guide O�Malley for the last 500 yards, and he hoped he had arrived in time. He parked behind the three other cars in the parking lot to avoid as much wind as possible, slipped into the right-hand seat and awkwardly wrestled his way into his raincoat before stepping out into the wind-whipped deluge.<br><br> With his tattered Bible tucked deep inside his overcoat pocket, O�Malley forced the car door open, stepped out and then leaned into the wind. Its power almost bowled him over, and he was nearly blown away from the hospital entrance. Once inside, the wind slammed the hospital door shut behind him, and as he was shaking the water from his coat, he heard footsteps headed his way. It was the night nurse.<br><br> �I�m so glad you could get here,� she said. �The man I called you about is slipping fast, but he is still coherent. He�s been an alcoholic for years, and his liver has finally given out. He�s been here for a couple of weeks this time and hasn�t had one single visitor. He lives up in the woods, and no one around here knows much about him. He always pays his bill with cash and doesn�t seem to want to talk much. We�ve been treating him off and on for the last couple of years, but this time it�s as though he�s reached some personal decision and has given up the fight.�<br><br> �What�s your patient�s name?� O�Malley asked.<br> �The hospital staff has just been calling him Tom,� she replied.<br> In the soft night-light of the room, Tom�s thin sallow countenance looked ghostlike behind a scraggly beard. It was as though he had stepped over the threshold and his life was already gone.<br><br> �Hello, Tom. I�m Father O�Malley. I was passing by and thought we could talk a bit before you go to sleep for the night.�<br> �Don�t give me any of that garbage,� Tom replied. �You didn�t just stop by at 3:30 in the morning. I asked that dumb night nurse to call someone to give me my last rites because I know my deal is done and it�s my turn to go. Now get on with it.�<br> �Patience,� said Father O�Malley, and he began to say the prayers of the last rites.<br><br> After the �Amen,� Tom perked up a bit, and he seemed to want to talk.<br> �Would you like to make your confession?� O�Malley asked him.<br> �Absolutely not,� Tom answered. �But I would like to just talk with you a bit, before I go.�<br> And so Tom and Father O�Malley talked about the Korean War, and the ferocity of the winter storm, and the knee-high grass and summer blossoms that would soon follow.<br><br> Occasionally, during the hour or so before daylight, Father O�Malley would ask Tom again, �Are you sure you don�t want to confess anything?�<br> After a couple of hours, and after about the fourth or fifth time that Father O�Malley asked the same question, Tom replied, �Father, when I was young, I did something that was so bad that I�ve never told anyone about it. It was so bad that I haven�t spent a single day since without thinking about it and reliving the horror.�<br> �Don�t you think it would be good for you to tell me about it?� O�Malley asked.<br> �Even now, I still can�t talk about what I did,� Tom said. �Even to you.�<br> But as the first gray light of dawn crept into the room and began to form shadows, Tom sadly said, �Okay. It�s too late for anyone to do anything to me now, so I guess I might as well tell you.�<br><br> �I worked as a switchman on the railroad all my life, until I retired a few years ago and moved up here to the woods. Thirty-two years, two months and 11 days ago, I was working in Bakersfield on a night kind of like tonight.� Tom�s face became intense as the words began to tumble out. �It happened during a bad winter storm with a lot of rain, 50-mile-an-hour winds and almost no visibility. It was two nights before Christmas and to push away the gloom, the whole yard crew drank all through the swing shift. I was drunker than the rest of them, so I volunteered to go out in the rain and wind and push the switch for the northbound 8:30 freight.�<br><br> Tom�s voice dropped almost to a whisper as he went on. �I guess I was more drunk than I thought I was because I pushed that switch in the wrong direction. At 45 miles an hour that freight train slammed into a passenger car at the next crossing and killed a young man, his wife and their two daughters.<br> �I have had to live with my being the cause of their deaths every day since then.�<br> There was a long moment of silence as Tom�s confession of this tragedy hung in the air. After what seemed like an eternity, Father O�Malley gently put his hand on Tom�s shoulder and said very quietly, �If I can forgive you, God can forgive you, because in that car were my mother, my father and my two older sisters.�<br><br> <i>Warren Miller</i><br><br><br> <p>�1996 Warren Miller.

I found the most insane conspiracy theories, essays, and propositions, which I could then use to incite heated debate on my radio show. Not just flat earth but <i>cubed</i> earth, or strawberry-ice-cream-eating aliens living at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, or a pseudoscientific study claiming that vampire strippers make more in tips than mortal strippers because of their hypnotic powers. (Vampire strippers? Really? And could I get one on the show for an interview?) Or I could click through useless links for hours and feel like I&#x2019;ve wasted a day. <br>Sometimes, I typed in my search request and found treasure. <br>The image currently on my screen was a photograph of a statue called the <i>Capitoline Wolf</i>. The sculpture showed a rather primitive-looking wolf with stylized, patterned fur; a glaring, snarling expression; and a couple of human babies suckling at rows of impressively bulging nipples. Housed in a museum in Rome, the age of the wolf portion of the statue was under some debate. Historically, it had been assumed that it was old&#x2014;pre-Roman, Etruscan even, because of its stocky shape and decidedly nonclassical features. Roman writers even made reference to a famous statue of a wolf that symbolized the founding of Rome. But modern dating techniques established the statue&#x2019;s origin in the late medieval period. The babies&#x2014;fat and cherubic, in Renaissance detail&#x2014;had obviously been added later, in the fifteenth century. Wherever it came from, whenever it was made, the statue depicted the legend of the founding of Rome: the she-wolf who discovered the abandoned brothers, Romulus and Remus, and saved their lives. They went on to found the great city of Rome. The statue was so iconic that copies of it could be found all over the world. <br>That was the official, published, accepted story of the <i>Capitoline Wolf.</i> However, I had my own ideas. Other details about the statue intrigued me. For example, the wolf wasn&#x2019;t life size, but it was a bit larger than a female wolf living in that part of the world would be. An average female wolf would weigh about seventy-five pounds, give or take ten pounds. A wolf the size of this statue might weigh, oh, a hundred-ten pounds or so. The weight of a small woman. <br>Shape-shifters obeyed the law of conservation of mass. A two-hundred-pound man becomes a two-hundred-pound wolf. Hundred-and-thirty-pound me becomes a hundred-thirty-pound wolf. A two-hundred-pound were-bear becomes&#x2014;a really small bear. I&#x2019;d never actually seen a were-bear in bear form, so I didn&#x2019;t know what that looked like. Whether I <i>wanted</i> to see what that looked like depended on the temperament of the bear. When I read about the <i>Capitoline Wolf,</i> learned about the dimensions of the statue, made a mental comparison to the werewolves I&#x2019;d met in both human and wolf form, my heart beat a little quicker. My journalistic instincts for a good story sang out. Because I wondered then if the story of Romulus and Remus had some basis in reality, and I wondered about the werewolf who&#x2019;d rescued them. <br>This was all the fruit of a pointed line of research that steered me in the direction of the <i>Capitoline Wolf.</i> I&#x2019;d heard a phrase: Regina Luporum. Queen of the wolves. According to an ancient vampire I&#x2019;d met, the story of Romulus and Remus was real&#x2014;the mother werewolf was real. The Capitoline Wolf, the foster mother of the founders of Rome, had been the original queen of the wolves. I&#x2019;d been told this label was used to describe werewolves who defended their kind when few others did. Who spoke out and stood up for what was right. A couple of times lately, <i>I&#x2019;d</i> been called Regina Luporum. It wasn&#x2019;t a title I claimed for myself or thought I deserved. I was half of the alpha pair of the Denver werewolf pack, which was small, unassuming, and generally sedate as werewolf packs went, because my husband, Ben, and I worked hard to keep it that way. <br>On the other hand, publicly and professionally, I had a big mouth. I talked too much. That didn&#x2019;t make me queen of anything. <br>The statue might have been made in the thirteenth century, belying the tradition and ancient references that said it had stood watch in Rome from the beginning. But that didn&#x2019;t mean it might not be a copy of an earlier piece that had been destroyed. Maybe copies of the statue had been made over and over to ensure that some memory of the events it memorialized lived on. To provide continuity, to create a tradition that might become muddled over time, but would still exist in one form or another. <br>Stories faded. The existence of werewolves was not openly acknowledged, so she became a wolf rather than a wolf-woman, because then the tale was just another animal fable harkening back to Aesop, or Ovid&#x2019;s <i>Metamorphoses,</i> and that somehow seemed safer, more legendary. Time changes stories, no matter how carefully they&#x2019;re written down. Maybe the <i>Capitoline Wolf</i> existed in one form or another two thousand years ago, maybe it didn&#x2019;t. Maybe the legend was true, or maybe it was a metaphor for something else entirely. Mostly, I looked at the alert and glaring expression of the statue, and saw the face of someone who must have been a hero. <br>Another thing I saw when I looked at the statue: the babies weren&#x2019;t hers&#x2014;they&#x2019;d been added later. She&#x2019;d found them and claimed them. Adopted them. This gave me hope. Women werewolves couldn&#x2019;t bear children because embryos didn&#x2019;t survive the trauma of shape-shifting. I couldn&#x2019;t have children of my own&#x2014;or maybe I could. <br>I printed out the image in full color. I wanted to be able to study the <i>Capitoline Wolf</i> whether my computer was on or off, by sunlight or by candlelight, not glowing in pixels on a screen. Kind of crazy, kind of romantic, but the picture in printed form seemed to have more dignity, more permanence. When the page emerged from the printer, I tacked it onto the corkboard on my office wall, right next to the full-page picture of another one of my heroes, General William T. Sherman. A couple of years ago, I followed up some <i>other</i> stories, some hunches, and determined that Sherman also had been a werewolf. Another one who stood up for what he believed. I wondered if history was in fact littered with werewolves. <br>I leaned back in my chair in my cramped and cozy office at KNOB, my desk filled with mail and newspaper clippings, internal memos, and a million notes on scratch paper, a radio in the corner humming softly with the station&#x2019;s daytime alternative music format, and studied the pictures, my two werewolf heroes. They were smart, tough, savvy, and they&#x2019;d made a difference in the world. They&#x2019;d had battles to fight and had fought them, and lived on in song and story. <br>If they could do it, maybe I could do it, too. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>MY EXCUSE for all this research: I was supposed to be writing my second book. <br>My first book had been a memoir&#x2014;the life and times of America&#x2019;s first celebrity werewolf. This one wasn&#x2019;t going to be about me. It was going to be about history, stories, and the different ways of interpreting them, because they look different when you know that vampires and lycanthropes are real. I wasn&#x2019;t the first person to suggest that Norse berserkers might have been werewolves, but I was going to take the idea and run with it. I was going to talk about the <i>Capitoline Wolf,</i> and those Greek myths about people turning into something else. From the beginning, people told stories about the ways humans and animals interacted with each other&#x2014;and the roles of each weren&#x2019;t always clearly defined. Animals talked, people went mad and ran off to the woods, and maybe it wasn&#x2019;t always a metaphor. Maybe Daniel survived the lion&#x2019;s den because he knew how to talk to the lions. <br>I&#x2019;d learned this once, but now I was being reminded in agonizing detail: announcing that you were writing a book was easy. Signing the contract and depositing the check were <i>very</i> easy. Actually doing it? Not as easy. Research, online or otherwise, was lots of fun and often yielded treasure, but it was also a deep, endless tunnel one could enter and never return from. I had stacks of notes that I needed to turn into text. Just wishing it would happen wasn&#x2019;t working. <br>When writing at my office at KNOB didn&#x2019;t work anymore, I rotated back home, to the office in the spare bedroom. I&#x2019;d pinned up a photo of the <i>Capitoline Wolf</i> there as well and sometimes caught myself staring at it, my mind wandering. <br>Since Ben and I moved out of the condo and bought an honest-to-God house, we now had a home office, half mine and half his. Pretty swank. He was a lawyer with his own practice, mostly criminal defense, a job that involved a lot more paperwork and phone calls than the TV shows let on. I tried not to sprawl out of my half of the room, but with the piles of books and articles I&#x2019;d collected for research, this was getting difficult. Not to mention outlines, abandoned outlines, rough drafts, and notes from editorial phone calls. If the amount of information I&#x2019;d collected was any sign, I ought to have more than enough for a book, assuming I could put it all together. I felt good, looking at my masses of notes. Productive. I could finish and actually make those shiny new house payments. <br>The room wasn&#x2019;t that big to begin with&#x2014;ten feet or so on a side, with two desks and a couple of bookshelves shoehorned in. Ben and I could wheel our chairs back and run into each other if we aimed right. Fortunately, he spent as much time out of the office as in it, meeting with clients or appearing in court, so I could do what I wanted. Hence, the sprawl. It was so nice having the <i>space.</i> <br>After dark, I heard a familiar sedan engine hum from down the street, grow close, then stop. Ben&#x2019;s car, parking in the driveway. A moment later, the front door opened and closed, and his scent touched the air. My nose flared, taking in the smell of my mate&#x2014;male, paperwork, and coffee, the wolfish fur-and-skin of lycanthropy. I smiled. The house was nice, but it didn&#x2019;t feel like home until Ben was here. <br>His footsteps approached, and I turned to greet him just as he appeared in the doorway. <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said, grinning. <br>He glanced at me, but spent more time looking around at the rest of the office. &#x201c;I take it you&#x2019;ve been busy.&#x201d; <br>The sprawl had gotten particularly bad this afternoon. I was sitting on the floor, books open around me, manuscript pages marked up with color-coded sticky notes tucked into them, pictures tacked to the wall or lying piled on the desk. If he was careful, he might be able to pick a path through the mess to his desk. <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a method to all this. I actually know where everything is.&#x201d; I was a little scared to start straightening up and moving things around&#x2014;I might never find anything again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fact-checking, making sure all the references match up. It means I&#x2019;m almost done. It&#x2019;s a good thing.&#x201d; I tried to sound confident, but ended up sounding defensive. <br>He pursed his lips, like he was trying to stop himself from saying something. He finally let out a sigh. &#x201c;Then maybe it&#x2019;s a good thing I&#x2019;m going away for a couple of days. You&#x2019;ll have a chance to work in peace.&#x201d; <br>I shoved books and papers away so I could scramble to my feet. &#x201c;What? No! Terrible things happen when you go away.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Terrible things happen when <i>you</i> go away. I&#x2019;m just a normal guy who has to take a business trip.&#x201d; <br>I could have argued with the normal. Once I was standing in front of him, I couldn&#x2019;t resist&#x2014;I pressed myself to him, wrapped my arms around him, and leaned in for a kiss, which he was all too happy to give me. I didn&#x2019;t even let him put his briefcase down first so he could hug me back properly. He just dropped it. <br>Yeah, I could have stayed like that for a good long while. &#x201c;Business trip where?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Cheyenne. Friend of the family got in some trouble over illegally grazing his cattle on federal land. I&#x2019;m going to go help clear it up.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That sounds&nbsp;&#x2026; arcane.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be fun. This is the kind of thing that got me into law in the first place. The initial hearing&#x2019;s in a couple of days, and depending how that goes, I may not have to go back.&#x201d; Unless something went wrong, in which case he could be making this trip back and forth for months. <br>&#x201c;Better you than me. Do you really have to stay there overnight?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d spend more time driving back and forth than I would on the case. Unless you really have a problem with it.&#x201d; He said it hopefully, like he wanted me not to be able to live without him for even a day. <br>We were pack, and this was our territory. He was my mate, and we belonged together. That was what Wolf said, wanting to cling to him at the mere suggestion of a separation. The world always felt off-kilter when we were apart. We&#x2019;d barely been apart in years. But we were also human, with careers and responsibilities. A normal human couple coped fine with the occasional business trip. We ought to be able to as well. <i>Or not,</i> Wolf grumbled. <br>Theoretically, I could go to Wyoming with him while he worked. But he was right&#x2014;having the house to myself might help me get work done. <br>&#x201c;Only a couple of days?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Promise?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then I suppose I should take advantage of you while I have the chance,&#x201d; I said, hooking my hands over the waistband of his trousers, pulling even closer to him, pressing as much of myself to his body as I could, feeling gratified when his skin flushed and he responded, his hands crawling to my backside. <br>&#x201c;Yes, please,&#x201d; he said, bringing his lips to mine for some very enthusiastic encouragement as I wrapped my arms around his neck. <br>My phone rang. Generic cell phone ring tone, so no clue who it might be. Nose to nose, Ben and I regarded each other. <br>&#x201c;It could be important,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;It could be telemarketers,&#x201d; I replied. <br>If nothing else, the electronic ringing was annoying enough that I wanted to go shut it off before it drove me batty. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll probably just take a second,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going anywhere,&#x201d; he said with a suggestive lilt to his brow that made my scalp tingle. Yup, he&#x2019;s a keeper. <br>After digging my phone out from under the mess of papers on my desk, I checked the caller ID, which stated that the incoming number was in Washington, D.C. Which meant the call could still be important or telemarketers. <br>Keeping an eye on Ben&#x2019;s cute smirk, I clicked the button and answered. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Kitty, it&#x2019;s Alette.&#x201d; <br>I frowned. This was important. Alette was the Mistress of Washington, D.C., quite possibly the most powerful vampire in the U.S., and she sounded somber, no brightness at all to her voice. She appeared to be a dignified woman in her thirties, but near as I could tell was several centuries old. She spoke with a commanding English accent. Now, she sounded tired. <br>&#x201c;Alette, hi, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; Ben&#x2019;s amusement fell away, his brow furrowing. Before she spoke, a thousand terrible scenarios passed through my mind. This was about Rick, wasn&#x2019;t it? Something had happened to Rick&#x2014; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve lost Barcelona.&#x201d; <br>The statement made no sense. I had to parse it, then catch up with the pronouncement. Barcelona was one of the cities we counted as an ally in our underground war against Roman and the Long Game&#x2014;or maybe not, anymore. &#x201c;What do you mean, we&#x2019;ve lost Barcelona? What about Antony&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Antony is gone.&#x201d; <br>I slumped against the desk. Again, the statement made no sense. My heart heard it, but my brain had to catch up.

Yet Gay's themes are much larger than the somewhat obscure Schnitzler: "If we may call [my book] a biography at all, it is one of a class," he writes. <i>Schnitzler's Century</i> necessarily focuses on the Victorians--a term often applied only to the British, but here extended to all of Europe and the United States--and Gay seeks to portray them in their complexity and diversity. "There are many people who think they have grasped the Victorian mentality when they have smiled at gushy keepsakes, maudlin poems, shy euphemisms, silences about matters that matter," he writes. In fact, "they lived with their eyes open." Gay has written a history of habits, with close attention paid to sexual ones. It is the sort of provocative book that the stereotypical Victorian would want to see removed from the storefront window--but also would want to peek at when nobody else was looking. --<i>John Miller</i>Peter Gay is the author of more than forty books, including the best-selling <i>Freud: A Life for Our Times</i> and the National Book Award winner <i>The Enlightenment.</i></p><h2>Samurai Space Opera (No Need for Tenchi!

Practical Printmaking includes contributions from numerous experts in the field of printmaking, including lecturers and artists.Artbookreview.net:Printmaking is a huge subject that includes many different techniques from basic linocut to engraving, intaglio and silkscreen. As soon as you get beyond the very basic, the equipment requirements mount up and some of the materials start to come with hazard warnings.A simple book such as this can really only scratch the surface (sorry, pun unavoidable) of something which rapidly becomes the realm of the professional and on which much larger and more authoritative books have been written, not to mention academic courses run.So where does this fit into the market? To describe it as superficial is unfair because the author makes a valiant attempt to include a reasonable amount of detail on each technique and it works well as a primer for someone who&#39;s starting out and wants to give printmaking a try. At the same time, that person is going to have to make a certain investment in equipments and materials and I&#39;m not totally convinced that they&#39;ll get what they&#39;d regard as a worthwhile return if their only source of instruction is a general introduction like this. I&#39;d expect at least evening classes to be involved somewhere and that begs the question of whether a book like this will add anything to what they&#39;re already getting.However, to be more positive, if you&#39;re interested in printmaking and want an overview of the various types and techniques available before you take the plunge, this will fit the bill admirably. Louise Woods goes into more detail than you might expect and you&#39;ll get a very real sense of what&#39;s involved. It should also be possible to make a basic start using simple materials, although this is inevitably going to be a very limited progression.For what it is, this is sound. It&#39;s in the same format as the Artist&#39;s Bible series: that is to say, it&#39;s spiral bound, though I can&#39;t quite see the point of this as it&#39;s not really something you&#39;re going to need to keep open as you work. It feels nice in the hand, though, an often-neglected quality in books.</p><h2>Lily And The Octopus (Thorndike Basic)</h2><p>A man is reminded of how it feels to love fiercely, to fight for a loved one, and to work through the pain of letting go as he becomes gradually aware of his devoted bond with his aging canine companion.</p><p>Steven Rowley has worked as a freelance writer, newspaper columnist, and screenwriter. Originally from Portland, Maine, he is a graduate of Emerson College. He currently resides in Los Angeles with his boyfriend and their dog. <i>Lily and the Octopus</i> is his first novel. Follow him on social media @MrStevenRowley.Lily and the Octopus <br>It&#x2019;s Thursday the first time I see it. I know that it&#x2019;s Thursday because Thursday nights are the nights my dog, Lily, and I set aside to talk about boys we think are cute. She&#x2019;s twelve in actual years, which is eighty-four in dog years. I&#x2019;m forty-two, which is two hundred and ninety-four in dog years&#x2014;but like a really young two hundred and ninety-four, because I&#x2019;m in pretty good shape and a lot of people tell me I could pass for two hundred and thirty-eight, which is actually thirty-four. I say this about our ages because we&#x2019;re both a little immature and tend to like younger guys. We get into long debates over the Ryans. I&#x2019;m a Gosling man, whereas she&#x2019;s a Reynolds gal, even though she can&#x2019;t name a single movie of his that she would ever watch twice. (We dropped Phillipe years ago over a disagreement as to how to pronounce his name. FILL-a-pea? Fill-AH-pay? Also because he doesn&#x2019;t work that much anymore.) Then there&#x2019;s the Matts and the Toms. We go back and forth between Bomer and Damon and Brady and Hardy depending on what kind of week it has been. And finally the Bradleys, Cooper and Milton, the latter of whom is technically way older and long dead and I&#x2019;m not sure why my dog keeps bringing him up other than she loves board games, which we usually play on Fridays.<br> <br>Anyhow, this particular Thursday we are discussing the Chrises: Hemsworth and Evans and Pine. It&#x2019;s when Lily suggests offhandedly we also include Chris Pratt that I notice the octopus. It&#x2019;s not often you see an octopus up close, let alone in your living room, let alone perched on your dog&#x2019;s head like a birthday party hat, so I&#x2019;m immediately taken aback. I have a good view of it, as Lily and I are sitting on opposite sides of the couch, each with a pillow, me sitting Indian style, her perched more like the MGM lion.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lily!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have to include Chris Pratt, it was just a suggestion,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>&#x201c;No&#x2014;what&#x2019;s that on your head?&#x201d; I ask. Two of the octopus&#x2019;s arms hang down her face like chin straps.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean, where? There. Over your temple on the right side.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lily pauses. She looks at me for a moment, our eyes locked on each other. She breaks my gaze only to glance upward at the octopus. &#x201c;Oh. That.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, that.&#x201d;<br> <br>I immediately lean in and grab her snout, the way I used to when she was a pup and would bark too much, so excited by the very existence of each new thing encountered that she had to sing her enthusiasm with sharp, staccato notes: LOOK! AT! THIS! IT! IS! THE! MOST! AMAZING! THING! I&#x2019;VE! EVER! SEEN! IT&#x2019;S! A! GREAT! TIME! TO! BE! ALIVE! Once, when we first lived together, in the time it took me to shower she managed to relocate all of my size-thirteen shoes to the top of the staircase three rooms away. When I asked her why, her reply was pure conviction: THESE! THINGS! YOU! PUT! ON! FEET! SHOULD! BE! CLOSER! TO! THE! STAIRS! So full of ebullience and ideas.<br> <br>I pull her closer to me and turn her head to the side so I can get a good, long look. She gives me the most side-eye she can muster in annoyance, disgusted with both the molestation and unwanted attention, and my gaucheness as a big, stupid human man.<br> <br>The octopus has a good grip and clings tightly over her eye. It takes me a minute, but I gather my nerve and poke it. It&#x2019;s harder than I would have imagined. Less like a water balloon, more like . . . bone. It feels subcutaneous, yet there it is, out in the open for all to see. I count its arms, turning Lily&#x2019;s head around to the back, and sure enough, there are eight. The octopus looks angry as much as out of place. Aggressive perhaps is a better word. Like it is announcing itself and would like the room. I&#x2019;m not going to lie. It&#x2019;s as frightening as it is confounding. I saw a video somewhere, sometime, of an octopus that camouflaged itself so perfectly along the ocean floor that it was completely undetectable until some unfortunate whelk or crab or snail came along and it emerged, striking with deadly precision. I remember going back and watching the video again and again, trying to locate the octopus in hiding. After countless viewings I could acknowledge its presence, sense its energy, its lurking, its intent to pounce, even if I couldn&#x2019;t entirely make it out in form. Once you had seen it, you couldn&#x2019;t really unsee it&#x2014;even as you remained impressed with its ability to hide so perfectly in plain sight.<br> <br>This is like that.<br> <br>Now that I&#x2019;ve seen it, I can&#x2019;t unsee it, and the octopus transforms Lily&#x2019;s entire face. A face that has always been so handsome to me, a noble and classic dog profile, betrayed only slightly by a dachshund&#x2019;s ridiculous body. Still, that face! Perfect in its symmetry. When you pulled her ears back it was like a small bowling pin covered in the softest mahogany fur. But now she looks less like a bowling pin in shape and more like a worn-down bowling pin in occupation; her head sports a lump as if it had actually been the number-one pin in a ten-pin formation.<br> <br>Lily snorts at me twice with flared nostrils and I realize I&#x2019;m still holding her snout. I let go of her, knowing she is seething at the indignity of it all.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it,&#x201d; she says, tucking her head to gnaw at an itch on her stomach.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I do want to talk about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mostly I want to talk about how it could be possible that I&#x2019;ve never seen it before. How I could be responsible for every aspect of her daily life and well-being&#x2014;food, water, exercise, toys, chews, inside, outside, medication, elimination, entertainment, snuggling, affection, love&#x2014;and not notice that one side of her head sports an octopus, alarmingly increasing it in size. The octopus is a master of disguise, I remind myself; its intent is to stay hidden. But even as I say this silently in my head I wonder why I&#x2019;m letting myself so easily off the hook.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does it hurt?&#x201d;<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a sigh. An exhale. When Lily was younger, in her sleep she would make a similar noise, usually right before her legs would start racing, the preamble to a beautiful dream about chasing squirrels or birds or pounding the warm sand on an endless golden beach. I don&#x2019;t know why, but I think of Ethan Hawke answering the standard questionnaire inspired by Bernard Pivot that ended every episode of Inside the Actors Studio:<br> <br>&#x201c;What sound or noise do you love?&#x201d;<br> <br>Puppies sighing, Ethan had said.<br> <br>Yes! Such a wonderful juxtaposition, sighing puppies. As if warm, sleeping puppies felt anything lamentable or had weariness or exasperations to sigh over. And yet they sighed all the time! Exhalations of sweet, innocent breath. But this sigh is different. Subtly. To the untrained ear it might not be noticeable, but I know Lily about as well as I think it&#x2019;s possible to know another living thing, so I notice it. There&#x2019;s a heaviness to it. A creakiness. There are cares in her world; there is weight on her shoulders.<br> <br>I ask her again. &#x201c;Does it hurt?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her answer comes slowly, after great pause and consideration. &#x201c;Sometimes.&#x201d;<br> <br>The very best thing about dogs is how they just know when you need them most, and they&#x2019;ll drop everything that they&#x2019;re doing to sit with you awhile. I don&#x2019;t need to press Lily further. I can do what she has done for me countless times, through heartbreak and illness and depression and days of general uneasiness and malaise. I can sit with her quietly, our bodies touching just enough to generate warmth, to share the vibrating energy of all living things, until our breathing slows and falls into the parallel rhythm it always does when we have our quietest sits.<br> <br>I pinch the skin on the back of her neck as I imagine her mother once did to carry her when she was a pup.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a wind coming,&#x201d; I tell her. Staring down the octopus as much as I dare, I fear there&#x2019;s more truth to that statement than I&#x2019;d like. Mostly I am setting Lily up to deliver her favorite line from Elizabeth: The Golden Age. Neither of us has actually seen the film, but they played this exchange endlessly in the commercials back when it was in theaters and we both would collapse in fits of laughter at the sound of Cate Blanchett bellowing and carrying on as the Virgin Queen. My dog does the best Cate Blanchett impression.<br> <br>Lily perks up just a bit and delivers her response on cue: &#x201c;I, too, can command the wind, sir! I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare if you dare to try me! Let them come with the armies of hell; they will not pass!&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a good effort, one she makes for me. But if I&#x2019;m being honest, it isn&#x2019;t her best. Instinctually she probably already knows what is fast becoming clear to me: she is the whelk; she is the crab; she is the snail.<br> <br>The octopus is hungry.<br> <br>And it is going to have her.</p><h2>The Plainsman (Men of the Saddle Series #4)</h2><p>Trey McAllister is on his way home to Tyrone, Kansas, after three years away fighting in the Union Army.

Towards the end of his life, he gave up his principal career as an architect and moved to the south of France where he devoted himself to painting in watercolor. Meticulously executed and brilliantly colored, these landscape watercolors are conceived with a sense of design and an eye for pattern in nature, which owes much to his brilliance as an architect and designer. This book charts Mackintosh's time in France and explores his career as a landscape painter, placing his work in the context of the modern movement. The forty-four paintings Mackintosh is known to have completed while in France are illustrated, and are supported by documentary photographs of the places he painted as well as extracts from his letters written to his wife and friends.<br>This new, revised edition of an enduringly popular title on one of Scotland's best-loved artists contains a new foreword by the Director General of the National Galleries of Scotland, Sir John Leighton, and will feature a new cover design, updated to feature the popular flexicover binding.</p><p>Pamela Robertson is a leading authority on the works of Mackintosh and his circle.

Most nature books capture animals in their native habitats. Brad Wilson decided to try a different approach&#x2015;bringing animals into his studio and photographing each against a solid black background. The results are electrifying. By minimizing the distractions of background, Wilson allows us to focus solely on the animals. This book allows the reader to fully appreciate each animal&#x2019;s expression, posture, size and the remarkable textures and colors of fur, hides, or feathers. As he explains in the introduction, Wilson faced enormous challenges in undertaking this project. He needed to find animals that responded to trainers, for his own safety as much as for the need for the animals to remain still. At the same time, he had to be patient with the animals&#x2019; own impulses. As he notes, &#x201c;I was facing subjects that did what they wanted with no regard for me or my artistic agenda. Specific verbal directions were replaced by patient waiting and observation.... In the midst of our modern human civilization with all its technological complexities, animals still remain stark symbols of a simpler life and a wilderness lost.&#x201d; From giraffes and zebras to owls and eagles, from chimpanzees and baboons to alligators and elephants, this gorgeous collection celebrates the beauty and dignity of the animal kingdom like no other book before it.</p><p>BRAD WILSON&#39;s work has been published worldwide in advertising campaigns, magazines, music packages, and hundreds of book covers in several continents. He currently resides in Santa Fe, New Mexico."Artists, photographers, and designers have long used the color black as a background to create contrast and focus, making their subjects pop forward and grab you. . . Rather than photographing the animals in the wild, Wilson brought them into his studio so that he could frame them against a solid black background."<br><br><p>&#x2014;<i>BeautifulNow</i></p><br><br>"The pictures manage to be beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time."<br><br><p>&#x2014;<i>A Photo Editor</i></p></p><h2>Twelve Steps Toward Political Revelation</h2><p>In his late teens and early twenties, Walter Mosley was addicted to alcohol and cigarettes.

His introduction to warfare came at the invasion of Normandy on D-Day in 1944.</p><p>Webster went on to see considerable action in the next two years, serving as a combat infantryman in the campaign through northwest Europe, during which he was twice wounded. He wrote <i>Parachute Infantry</i> a short time after the war, relying on his letters home and recollections he penned right after his discharge, making his memoir much closer to the war than most such works. With its abundant dialogue, charged descriptions of places and events, and skillful evocation of emotions, Webster&#x2019;s narrative resonates with the immediacy of a gripping novel.</p><p>The memoir is divided into several episodes. The first takes place in May and June of 1944 and provides a detailed, suspenseful account of Webster&#x2019;s participation in the events of D-Day. The next covers several days in September, 1944, when Webster parachuted into Holland and then as part of a group of soldiers advanced through small towns, freeing them as the Germans retreated, until he was shot in the leg and forced to leave his unit. The narrative then picks up in February, 1945, after Webster has returned to his unit, and describes several weeks near the end of the war in Europe, when German resistance was still strong but weakening. Then comes the Allied victory in 1945. We see Webster&#x2019;s platoon arriving at Berchtes gaden (Hilter&#x2019;s vacation retreat in the Alps) right before V-E Day and the celebrations and lax discipline that followed the final collapse of the Third Reich. In the last section of the book, Webster recalls the monotonous routine of occupation duty, concluding with his return to the States in early 1946 to be discharged.</p><p>Stephen E. Ambrose introduces <i>Parachute Infantry,</i> pointing out as two important strengths Webster&#x2019;s honesty and his ability to describe so well his fellow soldiers&#x2015;men he never would have known or associated with in civilian life but with whom he developed the strongest bonds during his wartime experience.</p><p><i>Parachute Infantry</i> proves to be a riveting account of a young soldier&#x2019;s experience of war.</p></p><p>David Kenyon Webster's memoir is a clear-eyed, emotionally charged chronicle of youth, camaraderie, and the chaos of war. Relying on his own letters home and recollections he penned just after his discharge, Webster gives a first hand account of life in "E Company, 101st Airborne Division, crafting a memoir that resonates with the immediacy of a gripping novel. <br>From the beaches of Normandy to the blood-dimmed battlefields of Holland, here are acts of courage and cowardice, moments of irritating boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror, and pitched urban warfare. Offering a remarkable snapshot of what it was like to enter Germany in the last days of World War II, Webster presents a vivid, varied cast of young paratroopers from all walks of life, and unforgettable glimpses of enemy soldiers and hapless civilians caught up in the melee. Parachute Infantry is at once harsh and moving, boisterous and tragic, and stands today as an unsurpassed chronicle of war--how men fight it, survive it, and remember it.<p>David Kenyon Webster worked as a reporter and writer after the war. <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> published a brief portion of his memoir, but book publishers rejected his manuscript, seeking sensationalized novels of the war rather than authentic memoirs. He died in 1961 in a boating accident while shark fishing.</p><p>Stephen E. Ambrose (1936-2002), was Boyd Professor of History at the University of New Orleans and author of many biographies and histories, including <i>D-Day, June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II</i> and <i>Upton and the Army.</i></p></p><h2>Harcourt Health &amp; Fitness: Student Edition Grade 3 2007</h2><p>Harcourt Health &amp; Fitness: Student Edition Grade 3 2007, hardcover, 328 pages.</p><p></p><h2>Molly&#39;s Route 66 Adventure (The American Girls Collection)</h2><p>An interactive, journal-style book features historical photographs and eight souvenirs for girls to keep, including a secret decoder that lets girls unscramble clues throughout the book to help Molly win a prize in Royal Oil&#39;s Hollywood Mystery Code Contest. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Scrapbook History Two titles in the American Girls Collection provide a unique perspective on history with a handsome square scrapbook presentation, including vintage-style postcards and pullout souvenirs.

This book explores the graphic imagery and packaging that make fashion sell, putting the spotlight on the graphic designers and art directors who create the brand image -- from the labels inside clothes to the swing tags and shopping bags.</p><p>At the heart of the book are 25 case studies which investigate the creation of individual fashion brands with analysis of the graphics, from the typography to the colour choices, as well as show invitations, the website, fragrance and cosmetic images. Each case study will examine closely the working realtionships between the fashion and graphic designer. Art directors/fashion labels featured include Fabien Baron's work with Burberry and Armani; Alan Aboud and Paul Smith; Michael Nash and Alexander McQueen/ John Galliano; as well as the in-house graphic teams of Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Stella Mc Cartney, IIssey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Gar�ons.</p></p><p><p>Born in Liverpool, Tamsin Blanchard studied fashion journalism at St. Martin's College, and went on to work as fashion editor of the <em>Independent</em> and then style editor at the <em>Observer</em>.

Collected for the first time in one volume, you&#39;ll find GENESIS, BATTLE CRY, and HOMECOMING--three electrifying futuristic adventures that let loose the Robotech Defense Force against the most fearsome conquerers in the universe.</p><p><i>I&#x2019;ve brought death and suffering in such magnitude</i>, Zor thought. <i>It&#x2019;s only right that I spend the balance of my life</i> bringing <i>life</i>.<br><br>He looked out from the observation bay of his temporary groundside headquarters upon a planetary surface that had been lifeless a mere four days before. He saw before him a plain teeming with thriving vegetation. Already the Flowers of Life were sprouting, reaching their eager, knob-tipped shoots into the sunshine.<br><br>Zor, supreme intellect of his race and Lord of the Protoculture, nodded approvingly. At times the memories of his own past deeds, much less those of his species, seemed enough to drive him mad. But when he looked down on a scene like this, he could forget the past and be proud of his handiwork.<br><br>And above him, blocking out the light of the nearby primary, his gargantuan starship and super dimensional fortress was escaping, as he had directed. The satisfaction he felt from that and from seeing the germinated Flowers made it much easier to accept the fact that he was about to die.<br><br>He was tall and slender, with a lean, ageless face and a thick shock of bright starlight hair. The clothes he wore were graceful, regal, cut tight to his form, covered by a short cloak that he now threw back over one shoulder.<br><br>Zor could hear the alarm signals ring behind him, and the booming voice of a Zentraedi announced, &#x201c;Warning! Warning! Invid troop carriers are preparing to land! All warriors to their battlepods!&#x201d;<br><br>Zor gazed away from the beauty of the exterior scene, back to the harsh reality of the base, as towering Zentraedi dashed about, preparing for battle. Even though the appearance of the Invid had taken them by surprise, even though they were badly outnumbered and at a disadvantage since the enemy held the high ground, there was a certain eagerness to the Zentraedi; war was their life and their reason for being.<br><br>In that, they had met their match and more in the Invid. Zor found bitter irony in how his own poor judgment and the cruelty of the Robotech Masters&#x2014;his masters&#x2014;had turned a race of peaceful creatures, once content with their single planet and their introspective existence, into the most ferocious species in the known universe.<br><br>While subordinates strapped armor and weapons on his great body, Dolza, supreme commander of the Zentraedi, glared down at Zor. His colossal head, with its shaven, heavy-browed skull, gave him the aspect of a stone icon. &#x201c;We should have departed before the Flowers germinated! I warned you!&#x201d;<br><br>Dolza raised a metal-plated fist big enough to squash Zor. Unafraid, Zor looked up at him, though his faithful aide, Vard, was holding a hand weapon uneasily. Around them the base shook as armored Zentraedi and their massive fighting pods raced to battle stations.<br><br>&#x201c;What of the super dimensional fortress?&#x201d; Dolza demanded. &#x201c;What have you done with it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I sent it away,&#x201d; Zor answered calmly. &#x201c;To a place far removed from this evil, senseless war.It is already nearing the edge of space, too fast and too powerful for the Invid to stop.&#x201d;<br><br>That much, Dolza knew, was true. The dimensional fortress, Zor&#x2019;s crowning technological achievement, was the mightiest machine in existence. Nearly a mile long, it incorporated virtually everything Zor had discovered about the fantastic forces and powers springing from the Flowers of Life.<br><br>&#x201c;Sent it where?&#x201d; Dolza demanded. &#x201c;If I weren&#x2019;t sworn by my warrior oath to protect you&#x201d;&#x2014;Dolza&#x2019;s immense fist hovered close&#x2014;&#x201c;I would kill you!&#x201d;<br><br>A few pods from the ready-reaction force were already on the scene: looming metal battle vehicles big enough to hold one or two Zentraedi, their form suggesting that of a headless ostrich, with long, broad breastplates mounting batteries of primary and secondary cannon.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t expect you to understand,&#x201d; Zor said in carefully measured tones, as explosions and shock waves shook the base. They could hear the Zentraedi communication net crackling with reports of the Invid landing.<br><br>&#x201c;You were created to fight the Invid; that is what you must do,&#x201d; Zor told the giant as the headquarters&#x201d; outer wall heaved and began to crumble. &#x201c;Go! Fulfill your Zentraedi imperative!&#x201d;<br><br>As Zor spun and ducked for cover, Vard shielded him with his own body. Dolza turned to give battle as the wall shuddered and cracked wide. Through the showering rubble leapt Invid shock troopers, the enemy&#x2019;s heaviest class of mecha, advanced war machines. Forged from a superstrong alloy, bulky as walking battleships, the mecha resembled a maniac&#x2019;s version of biped insecr soldiers.<br><br>They were every bit as massive as the Zentraedi pods, and even more heavily armored. Concentrated fire from the few pods already on the scene&#x2014;blue lances of blindingly bright energy&#x2014;penetrated the armor of the first shock trooper to appear. Even as the Invid returned fire with streams of annihilation discs, the seams and joints of its armor expanded under the overwhelming pressure from the eruptions within. It exploded into bits of wreckage and white-hot shrapnel that bounded noisily off the pods&#x2019; armor.<br><br>But a trio of shock troopers had crowded in behind the first, and a dozen more massed behind them. Annihilation discs and red plasma volleys quartered the air, destroying the headquarters command center and equipment, setting fires, and blasting pods to glowing scraps or driving them back.<br><br>Armored Zentraedi warriors, lacking the time to reach their pods, rushed in to fight a desperate holding action, spraying the Invids with hand-held weapons, dodging and ducking, advancing fearlessly and suffering heavy casualties.<br><br>A swift warrior ran in under an Invid shock trooper, holding his weapon against a vulnerable joint in its armor and then triggering the entire charge all at once, point-blank. The explosion blew the Invid&#x2019;s leg off, toppling it, but the Zentraedi was obliterated by the detonation.<br>Elsewhere, an Invid mecha seized a damaged pod that could no longer fire, ripped the pod apart with its superhard metal claws, then dismembered the wounded Zentraedi within.<br><br>Scouts, smaller Invid machines, rushed in behind the shock troopers to scour the base.<br><br>It took only minutes for one to find Zor; the Invid had been searching for him for a long time and were eager for revenge.<br>As the scout lumbered toward them, Vard tried to save his lord by absorbing the first blast himself, firing his little hand weapon uselessly at the Invid monster. He partially succeeded, but only at the cost of his own life&#x2014;immolated in an instant by a disc. The force of the blast drove Zor back and scorched him.<br><br>The rest of the discs in the salvo were ignited by the explosion, but, having been flung aside, Zor was spared most of their fury. Still, he&#x2019;d suffered terrible injuries&#x2014;skin burned from his body until bone was exposed, lungs seared by fire, bones broken from the concussion and the fall, tremendous internal hemorrhaging. He knew he would die.<br><br>Before the Invid scout could finish the job, Dolza was there, firing at it with his disruptor rifle, ordering the remaining pods to concentrate their fire on it. &#x201c;Zor is down! Save Zor!&#x201d; he thundered. Switching to his helmet communicator, he tried to raise his most trusted subordinate.<br><br>&#x201c;Breetai! Breetai! Where are you?&#x201d;<br><br>The scout was blown to bits in the withering fusillade, but its call had gone out; the other scouts and shock troopers were homing in on their archenemy.<br><br>Dolza, with the remaining warriors and pods, formed a desperate defensive ring, unflinchingly ready to die according to their code.<br><br>Suddenly there was a massive volley from the right. Then an even more intense one from the left. To Dolza&#x2019;s astonishment, they were directed at the Invid.<br><br>Breetai had arrived at the head of reinforcements. Some of them were wearing only body armor like himself, but most were in tactical or heavily armed officers&#x2019;s Battlepods. The Invid line began to collapse before a storm of massed fire. More pods were arriving all the time. Dolza couldn&#x2019;t understand how&#x2014;an invasion force was descending by the thousands from a moon-size Invid hive ship, its troopers as uncountable as insects. Surely the base must be covered by a living, swarming layer of the enemy.<br><br>But the enemy was being driven back, and Breetai was leading a countercharge on foot, just as a small wedge of shock troopers threatened to make good on a suicide rush at Dolza and Zor. A disc struck a pod near Breetai even as he was firing left and right with his rifle; blast and shrapnel hit his head and the right side of his face.<br><br>Breetai dropped, skull aflame, but the Zentraedi countercharge went on&#x2014;somehow&#x2014;to drive the Invid back to the breach in the wall.<br><br>Finally Dolza wearily lowered his glowing rifle muzzle. Pursuit of the retreating Invid could be left to the field commanders. He began to take reports from the newcomers, thus learning the details of the unexpected Zentraedi victory.<br><br>Most of the Invid had been diverted in an attempt to stop or board the dimensional fortress and had been wiped out. Even now, word of the attack was going back to the Robotech Masters; a punitive raid would have to be mounted. Breetai was being attended to by the healersa and would live, though he would be scarred for life.<br><br>But all of that was of little moment to Dolza. He looked down on the smoking, broken body of Zor. Healers crowded around the fallen genius with their apparatus and machines, but Dolza had seen enough combat casualties to know that Zor was beyond help.<br><br>Zor knew it as well as Dolza. Drifting in a near delirium, feeling surprisingly little pain, he heard exchanges about the dimensional fortress. He smiled to himself, though it hurt his scorched face, thankful that the starship had escaped.<br><br>Once more, he had the Vision that had made him decide to dispatch the ship; as the master of the limitless power of the Protoculture, with his matchless intellect, he had access to hidden worlds of perception and invisible paths of knowledge.<br><br>He saw again an infinitely beautiful, blue-white world floating in space, one blessed with the treasure that was life. He sensed that it was or would be the crux of transcendent events, the crossroads and deciding place of a conflict that raged across galaxies.<br><br>A column of pure mind-energy rose from the planet, a pillar of dazzling force a hundred miles in diameter, crackling and swaying, swirling like a whirlwind, throwing out shimmering sheets of brilliance, climbing higher and higher into space all in a matter of moments.</p><h2>Mai Tai&#39;d Up (4) (The Cocktail Series)</h2><p>Looking for the perfect mix of smart, sexy, and sassy? <i>Mai Tai&#x2019;d Up</i> continues <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Alice Clayton&#x2019;s Cocktail series, which began with <i>Wallbanger</i> and continued with <i>Rusty Nailed</i> and <i>Screwdrivered.</i><br><br>The gossip mill in the seaside community of Monterey is churning about Chloe Patterson, the newcomer who is starting a sanctuary for rescued pit bulls.

And she finally got her Bernese Mountain Dog.Mai Tai&#x2019;d Up chapter one<p></p> <br>Four weeks later in San Diego<br> <br>&#x201c;And so tonight, I raise a glass to the most beautiful girl in the world&#x2014;my daughter, Chloe Patterson. And to her intended, I say: take care of her. Because I know people.&#x201d;<br> <br>I could feel my blush rise as my father toasted me and my fianc�&#x2014;the &#x201c;intended&#x201d; he&#x2019;d just threatened in front of the fifty people attending our rehearsal dinner. Threatened in a perfectly acceptable way, of course, like a father of the bride would tease the man who&#x2019;s going to take away his little girl forever. And everyone laughed along with me, raising their glasses in our direction.<br> <br>My intended, Charles Preston Sappington, rose to his feet, shaking my father&#x2019;s hand and clapping him on the back good-naturedly. Was the clap a little harder than necessary? Yes. Was the threat as affable as my father made it sound? No.<br> <br>I caught my dad&#x2019;s eye and he winked. I giggled loudly, earning an eye roll from my mother, who had the most audible eye roll in the room. In any room. And particularly any room my father was in.<br> <br>Relieved that I could get back to my dinner, I felt Charles&#x2019; hand on the back of my neck. He leaned over me, pressing an absentminded kiss onto the top of my head. &#x201c;Going to go say hello to the Nickersons; I&#x2019;ll be right back,&#x201d; he whispered.<br> <br>I kissed the air behind him as he sped off to press some more flesh, and turned to see my mother watching us.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think you should go with him, dear?&#x201d; she asked, watching as my fianc� schmoozed. Our rehearsal dinner, and he was schmoozing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not particularly. Did you try the artichoke souffl�? It&#x2019;s delicious,&#x201d; I answered, forking up another bite.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think you&#x2019;ve had enough, dear? That wedding dress barely fits as it is.&#x201d; She signaled for a waiter to remove my plate.<br> <br>I smiled resignedly, setting down my fork with a clatter that earned me an eyebrow raise. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I mumbled, patting at my lips delicately with my napkin, which I refolded and placed squarely in the center of my lap.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, leave her alone, Marjorie, she&#x2019;s getting married! She should enjoy this night! You know, before the Big Fade,&#x201d; Dad teased.<br> <br>A snort escaped me, and my mother&#x2019;s neck turned three shades of red.<br> <br>&#x201c;Honestly, Thomas, I hardly think it&#x2019;s appropriate to tease her like that, the night before she gets married. And what was that toast? You know people? For goodness&#x2019; sake, who are these alleged people? Accountants? Pencil pushers?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, lighten up! It was a joke, that&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; my father protested, clearly loving this.<br> <br>Divorced for the last six years after twenty-two years of bickering, my father loved nothing in the world more than to get my mother&#x2019;s back up. And she never failed to take the bait.<br> <br>But tonight, she surprised us both by pushing back from the table. &#x201c;Chloe, go stand with Charles. He shouldn&#x2019;t have to chat up all these guests by himself,&#x201d; she chided, not giving my father a second glance as she sailed away. Tall and regal and every inch the mother of the bride, she slipped seamlessly into the background, making sure that the waiters were circling and everyone had everything they needed. She was the hostess with the mostest, a job that I supposed I should be doing. Truth? I wanted more of that sinful artichoke souffl�.<br> <br>I glanced at my father&#x2019;s plate and he grinned, shoving it across the table toward me. I grinned back, then quickly ate the souffl�.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, you ready for tomorrow?&#x201d; he asked as we watched the room.<br> <br>Pleasantries, mingling, restrained and dignified laughter spilling around the room. Fifty of our very very closest friends and family. And this was only the rehearsal. Four hundred (four hundred!) people from all over Southern California had been invited to the wedding tomorrow, being held at one of San Diego&#x2019;s toniest country clubs. We&#x2019;d been members for years, and when my parents&#x2019; divorce was final, my mother made it clear that it was now her territory alone. But my father was required to pay the membership dues every year. Alimony.<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose,&#x201d; I said, and sighed, wondering not for the first time why I sighed every time someone asked me about the wedding.<br> <br>My father noticed. &#x201c;Kiddo?&#x201d; he asked, concern crossing his handsome face.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better go chat with the Nickersons,&#x201d; I answered, having just gotten the stink eye from my mother from across the room. She meant well. And it was my rehearsal dinner, after all; I should be enjoying hearing everyone&#x2019;s congratulations. I reminded myself of this several times in the time it took me to make my way from the corner table to the center of the restaurant, where my intended held his hand out for me. I pasted on the look of happiness and sincerity that had won me Miss Golden State nearly two years ago. Charles, the most handsome man I&#x2019;d ever known, smiled down at me, my smile taking its cue from his as he slipped his arm around me and brought me effortlessly into the conversation.<br> <br>Smile. Nod. Laugh. Smile. Nod. Laugh. Smile. Nod. Sigh.<br> <br>I stole a moment later in the evening, after the coffee had been served and the endless toasts completed (how in the world would anyone have anything to say tomorrow if they blew their toast wad at the rehearsal dinner?), and guests were beginning to edge toward the door. My mother mingled like a pro, smiling and nodding at each one as they complimented her on what a lovely daughter, what a lovely couple, what a lovely evening . . . arghh. Smiling and nodding was what she did best.<br> <br>It was a grace I didn&#x2019;t possess naturally, although I could fake it with the best of them. Case in point: my earlier smile and nod when a twenty-minute discussion was waged over which was the best lawn service in town. Have to keep those lawns as green as possible, even when there was a drought, you know. Or my smile and nod when Mrs. Snodgrass went on and on about a racy book that everyone was talking about but no one would admit to reading, when in fact I know every woman there had read it. I even smiled and nodded when Mr. Peterson lectured us about illegal immigration, when I knew for a fact that his nanny was undocumented. Honestly, I felt like a bobblehead at times. But that pageant training kicked in, and I could smile and nod for hours on end, always looking interested, always looking pleasant, always looking pretty.<br> <br>But inside my head wasn&#x2019;t pretty. Inside my head, I was wondering what would happen if I jumped onto a table and started screaming. What would the reaction be? Startlement? Horror? Amusement? How quickly would someone usher me off the table, and how quickly would everyone else go back to their coffee?<br> <br>I was saved from my mental screaming by my mother, who was making a second pass around the restaurant. &#x201c;Dear, the Snodgrasses are leaving. Be a good girl and go thank them for coming.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mother.&#x201d; I smiled and nodded. In particular at my handsome fianc�, who had already beaten me to the Mr. and Mrs. Snodgrass.<br> <br>Finally, Charles and I found ourselves alone in front of the restaurant. Before Cinderella was packed off into her stretch limo coach, she was to say good night to her handsome prince.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you excited about tomorrow?&#x201d; he asked, encircling me with his strong arms. Arms he kept strong, along with every other part of his body, with hours of tennis, racquetball, swimming, jogging, and, of course, golf. Avid golfer. I&#x2019;d been encouraged to take up the sport, so I did. Of course I did. Sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very excited for tomorrow,&#x201d; I murmured into his chest, catching the scent of his cologne. Heady.<br> <br>&#x201c;I mentioned to Nancy Nickerson that you&#x2019;d be interested in volunteering some time when we get back in town. She&#x2019;s chairing the committee for the new pediatric wing at the hospital. I signed you up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, okay. But I&#x2019;m not sure how much time I&#x2019;m going to have. They just got two new therapy dogs at the hospital, and they need some help with&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Chloe. Baby. We talked about this before. Working with your pageant platform is one thing; the therapy dog charity was great. But you&#x2019;re not doing pageants anymore, and we agreed it&#x2019;s time to start moving on, taking on some new projects, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But, Charles, I&#x2019;ve worked with this organization since high school; it was never just because I was in pageants. They always need help, and I think that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um. What?&#x201d; I asked, crinkling my nose and looking up at him.<br> <br>Charles Preston Sappington was tall. Dark. Handsome. Perfect. My mother, who traded in perfect, had introduced us. He was an attorney. He argued for a living, which is why I never bothered to argue with him. Hard to go toe-to-toe with the toughest litigator in all of Southern California. I know this because he had it on a plaque above his desk. So I rarely bothered. However . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you just tell me no?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you explain to me why?&#x201d; I asked, pushing against his chest a bit when he tried to hold me tighter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Baby, it&#x2019;s late. We&#x2019;ve got plenty of time to talk about stuff like this. But for now? Just concentrate on getting some sleep tonight so you can be beautiful for me tomorrow.&#x201d; His voice sounded soothing. &#x201c;You know I can&#x2019;t wait for tomorrow, right? But then after that? The honeymoon, baby&#x2014;the best part.&#x201d;<br> <br>His hands slid up my back and succeeded in pulling me into him. I sighed, bit back my remark, and concentrated on the band that was tightening around my chest. His arms, I mean.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two weeks in Tahiti. Private bungalow. Bikini. Maybe even no bikini,&#x201d; he whispered, hands sliding down and giving my bum a grab.<br> <br>&#x201c;Charles! Someone could see!&#x201d; I protested, looking around. He laughed, thinking this particular squall was over. After all, I was getting married tomorrow. Sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Baby, go to sleep. And then tomorrow, I&#x2019;ll be waiting at the end of that aisle. You&#x2019;ll be gorgeous. We&#x2019;ll say some words, slip on some rings, and then you&#x2019;re all mine. Sound good?&#x201d; he crooned as he spun me around, then set me down to open the limo door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mm-hmm,&#x201d; I managed, a bit dizzy from all the spinning.<br> <br>&#x201c;There you two are! Now, Charles, scoot. She&#x2019;s all yours tomorrow, but she&#x2019;s still mine tonight,&#x201d; my mother cried, appearing at my side with a grand smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mother Patterson,&#x201d; Charles replied, knowing how much she hated when he called her that.<br> <br>I giggled in spite of myself, and my mother frowned at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Say good night to Charles,&#x201d; she said primly, keeping any comments about Mother Patterson to herself for a change.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good night, Charles,&#x201d; I echoed, leaning in for a kiss on the forehead.<br> <br>&#x201c;Night, ladies. See you tomorrow,&#x201d; Charles said, packing us into the limo in a swish of silk and satin.<br> <br>Sitting next to my mother, I listened to her chatter as we pulled away from the restaurant and headed toward our home. Where I&#x2019;d lived since college.<br> <br>Parents&#x2019; house. Sorority house. Parents&#x2019; house. Husband&#x2019;s house? Sigh.<br> <br>An hour later, I was in the bedroom I&#x2019;d been sleeping in since I was seven. Canopy bed. Pom-poms. Tiaras. Sashes. Trophies. Pageant girl, remember? Elbow elbow wrist wrist.<br> <br>Curled up on top of the covers, I was hot, my heart beating faster than normal. Nervous about tomorrow, I suppose. Marrying Charles. Becoming a Sappington and everything that meant.<br> <br>I looked at the picture of us on my nightstand, taken the evening he&#x2019;d proposed. The ring shone as brightly in the photo as it shone on my hand now. It was the largest diamond I&#x2019;d ever seen, almost embarrassingly so. I slipped it off, setting next to the picture.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d met Charles eleven months ago. We were engaged five months to the day after we met. Whirlwind to say the least, and Charles was the most perfectly put-together whirlwind you&#x2019;ve ever seen. Never a hair out of place, never a spot of food on his tie, or a piece of spinach in his teeth. The spinach would never dare.<br> <br>But any piece of spinach would love to get the chance to lodge there. Charles Preston Sappington was the man about town, the bachelor every woman from San Diego to Santa Barbara had been trying to land for years. Any piece of spinach would count herself extremely lucky to be trapped between his pedigreed teeth; it was the dream tiny spinaches were told by their spinach mothers. Tall. Handsome. Rich. Good family. And if you do as you&#x2019;re told, you too can go for the brass ring.<br> <br>I was Miss Golden State. He was my final tiara after a lifetime of pretty and prancing. Now I could go quietly into that beautifully manicured good night, my wedding veil firmly in place. And a silent scream in the back of my throat.<br> <br>With that comforting thought&#x2014;and if by comforting, I mean abject terror&#x2014;I turned out my light.<br> <br>Toss. Turn. Toss. Turn. Toss. Turn. Tears.<br> <br>Looking back, I wish I could tell you there was one particular thing that tipped the scales and made me run away from my wedding. But all I know was that from the moment I set my feet on the floor that morning, I knew something was off. And not just my stomach, although that had been burbling and gurgling since 3 A.M. Too much artichoke souffl�? I&#x2019;ll never tell.<br> <br>I ate oatmeal practically every morning of my life. Steel-cut oats, the slightest sprinkling of Splenda, fresh fruit (blueberries were my mother&#x2019;s preferred choice&#x2014;antioxidants are our friends), with a splash of nonfat milk. But today when I shuffled into the kitchen, I saw something I had never seen there before.<br> <br>Donuts.<br> <br>Actual. Beautiful. Sugary. Fatty. Gorgeous. Donuts.<br> <br>Like, with the sugar and the fat.<br> <br>I looked around to make sure that, yes, I was still in my own house. My oatmeal bowl was set out, place mat and utensils laid with care, as it was every day. Slow cooker was plugged in, with my preportioned amount piping hot and ready for eating. The small pitcher of nonfat milk sat by my place setting, holding exactly a half cup of gray, watery, not-so-much milk.<br> <br>But . . . did I mention there were donuts?<br> <br>On reflection, I was wrong when I said I didn&#x2019;t know what tipped the scales that morning. Donuts were where I went off the rails.<br> <br>Taking one more look around to make sure no one was there to witness this culinary mortal sin, I walked over toward the platter. And regarded the donuts, piled high and arranged with attention toward making a beautifully delicious display. These confectionary wonders, these puffy delights, these sugary and fatty diet cheats&#x2014;I chose one toward the back, sticky with chocolate glaze and full of spite toward every diet I&#x2019;d ever been put on.<br> <br>I was a slim girl; genetics plus a Southern California lifestyle had made me so. Part of the reason I won Miss Golden State is due to the fact that I look exactly like every picture of the &#x201c;Wish they all could be&#x201d; variety of a California Girl. Long blond hair. Tan. Tall; not so much curves as there were hills and valleys; strong from running, tennis, Pilates, yoga, you name it. I&#x2019;d nevertheless had it drilled into me from a young age that skinny was better, and to enforce that, nary a donut was ever brought into this home. Of course, I&#x2019;d had them at friends&#x2019; slumber parties occasionally. And when I turned sixteen, and realized that a driver&#x2019;s license and a little bit of baby-sitting money allowed me the freedom to eat anything and everything&#x2014;which, to be fair, resulted in a weight gain of eleven pounds and a very stern lecture by my mother on healt...</p><h2>How to Draw Anything</h2><p>If you can write your name, you have enough touch to learn to draw.

When President James Buchanan predicted in 1858 that the country would someday be bound east and west &#34;by a chain of Americans which can never be broken,&#34; the links were already being forged by an army of entrepreneurs known as the Expressmen. Their freight and stagecoach services moved Eastern goods westward, Western ones eastward, and shuttled people, money and mail both ways. By 1860, Pony Express riders were relaying mail across more than half the country in the amazingly brief time of 10 days. Such labors, celebrated here and on the following pages in paintings by Western artists, were eventually to be supplanted by the railroads and the telegraph.

Visionaries, adventurers, artists, and scientists, these women challenged the limitations, both physical and social, of their times and, in the face of formidable challenges, expanded the world's body of knowledge. <br><br>Yet despite their extraordinary achievements, they have remained unknown and unsung for too long.<br><br>No longer. The stories of more than eighty extraordinary explorers and adventurers are vividly recounted and stunningly illustrated in <b>Women of Discovery</b>. Here for the first time are gathered the tales of early voyagers, such as the valiant tenth-century Viking adventurer Unn the Deep Minded and seventeenth-century Spanish conquistadora Catalina de Erauso. Intrepid explorers like Mary Kingsley in Africa, Alexandra David-Neel in Tibet, and Freya Stark in the Middle East traveled fearlessly into the blank spaces on the map. Artist explorers, including the great botanical painter Anna Maria Sibylla Merian in Surinam, writer Zora Neale Hurston in Haiti, and photographer Ruth Robertson in South America, captured in their art the beauty and mystery of exotic lands. Many brave women have ventured into extreme environments to bring back knowledge, whether they were aviators like Amelia Earhart, mountaineers like Annie Smith Peck, or Arctic explorers like Irina and Valentina Kuznetsova. And the annals of science would be far poorer without the work of such women as primatologists Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey, ethnobotanist Nicole Maxwell, and ichthyologist Eugenie Clark.<br><br>This is truly a gathering of heroines, full of tales of courage, talent, intelligence, and sheer determination. With a foreword by renowned journalist Christiane Amanpour, <b>Women of Discovery</b> is a remarkable book, an achievement in its own right, and certain to thrill anyone captivated by the world-changing drama of exploration.</p><p>Before graduating from Harvard in 1976, Milbry Polk journeyed through Greece, Turkey, Persia, Pakistan, and Japan, surveyed Arthurian sites in Wales, traveled with Bedouin tribesmen in Jordan and Egypt, and kayaked throughout Alaska's Prince William Sound. In 1979 Milbry led a camel expedition retracing the route of Alexander the Great across Egypt. Her photojournalistic work includes stories on sailing the Mediterranean, ancient rock carvings in the Saudi Arabian desert, and rafting above the Arctic Circle. Her previous book was <b>Egyptian Mummies</b>. She is a member of the Explorers Club and is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. She lives outside of New York City with her husband and three daughters.<br><br>Designer and writer Mary Tiegreen has been exploring the art of books and book making for most of her life. She has had the opportunity to learn about diverse areas of interest, including the history of Hollywood (<b>MGM: When the Lion Roared</b>), cooking and magic (<b>The Secrets of Pistoulet</b>), fashion (<b>A Passion for Shoes</b>), sex (<b>TarotSutra</b>), and golf (<b>Let the Big Dog Eat</b>). <b>Women of Discovery</b> is her first foray into the world of exploration. She lives in the Hudson Valley with her husband, Hubert, and big dog, Daisy.Adult/High School-"Celebration" is indeed the word for this exuberant assemblage of 84 amazing and outrageous individuals. Polk's vivid narratives capture the essence of each fascinating life and adventure, while Tiegreen's remarkable graphics create a sense of authenticity and immediacy, wrapping each account in a style that suits it perfectly. Readers feel they are witnesses to history thanks to well-chosen, first-person observations and ample visual contents such as contemporary maps, memorabilia, photos, and art. The "women of discovery" include aristocrats and paupers, ancient Vikings and modern scientists still in their prime. Some lives were more terrible than triumphant, but all "made comprehensible a part of the world that we didn't know, understand, or appreciate until they revealed it to us." The stories are loosely grouped into five freewheeling sections, each with a brief but thought-provoking introduction describing "Early Voyagers," "Intrepid Explorers," "Scientific Explorers," "Artist Explorers," and "Explorers on the Edge." Although a few of the names are well known (Maria Mitchell, Dian Fossey, Zora Neale Hurston), most will come as a complete surprise to readers, who will be wondering why they've never heard of these women before. This beautiful book is a browser's dream, but it should be equally attractive to students as a rich source of interesting research subjects. The authors hope that this book will guide anyone "[setting] forth on his or her own voyage of discovery."-Christine C.

Sheldon.Between her first SF story in 1968 and her suicide in 1987, Tiptree (the pseudonym of psychologist Alice Sheldon) produced a body of acclaimed if sometimes difficult work. Her approach to her characters, which had often been clinical and detached, had in recent years become a sentiment-filled array of heroes and victims in which contact with aliens put the humans in better contact with themselves. The angelic octopus-like creatures of "Second Going" offer Earth a substitute for the religious faith it lacks. "In the Midst of Life," an executive shoots himself, only to find a strange fulfillment in the afterlife. Most striking here is Tiptree's sardonic variation of the Peggy Sue Got Married theme in "Backward, Turn Backward," where what the characters find in their younger selves is not hope but hate and despair. Another uneven and unsettling collection from Tiptree. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Abruzzo Trilogy: Fontamara, Bread and Wine, The Seed Beneath the Snow</h2><p>The impoverished, desolate&nbsp;mountain regions of the Abruzzo during Mussolini's reign provide the backdrop for the three greatest novels by Ignazio Silone, one of the twentieth century's most important writers. In <i>Fontamara</i>, <i>Bread and Wine</i>, and <i>The Seed Beneath the Snow</i> - presented together for the first time in English to mark the centenary of the author's birth - Silone narrates the struggles of the cafoni, the farmers and peasants of his native Abruzzo, against poverty, natural disasters, and totalitarianism.<br> The first novel in the series, <i>Fontamara</i>, is a political fable that portrays the bitter trials of the villagers of Pescina as they battle with landowners who have appropriated their only source of water. First published from his exile in Zurich in 1933, and banned in his own country, the novel was translated into twenty languages and won Silone instant international literary fame.<br> Silone's masterpiece, <i>Bread and Wine</i>, introduces the semi-autobiographical character Pietro Spina, an anti-Fascist revolutionary who returns to his homeland after fifteen years in exile. He seeks refuge among the Abruzzo peasants by posing as the priest Don Paolo Spada. <br> Pietro's story continues in <i>The Seed Beneath the Snow</i>, Silone's personal favorite in the trilogy. Pietro Spina flees again and, with the police in close pursuit, is taken in by his grandmother Donna Maria Vincenza. Though comfortably settled in Italian bourgeois society, she jeopardizes her own life in order to protect him.</p><p>Ignazio Silone was born May 1, 1900 in the Abruzzo region of Italy.

Only in Americaor so this celebrity would have it, endlessly extolling his love of country as he recounts his government-sponsored goodwill missions around the world. Still, one can't fault him for his cloying patriotismhe is by no means a reactionaryor for pride in his achievements, this child of unlettered Jewish-Russian immigrants, the only son among seven offspring, raised in grueling poverty in upstate New York, who supported himself through college and acting school, became a considerable star and a millionaire. The most affecting memories here are of those early years and the son's relationship with the father, a heavy drinker and violent man; the most tedious, an extensive recap, seemingly requisite in show-biz bios, of sexual affairs. "I am very often attracted to women who have a slight overbite," he writesand there are many such, alas for bored readers. Twice married, once divorced, the father of four sons, the author, 71 years old, felt intimations of mortality following a heart seizure, which became for him an occasion to assess his life, to balance the books on Issur Danielovitch, known in boyhood as Izzy Demsky, in celebrity as Kirk Douglas. Authentic, revealing, unself-conscious and self-centered, his performance here is a star turn. Photos not seen by PW. First serial to Good Housekeeping. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.It seems that all it takes these days to have one's life recorded in print is that "15 minutes" of fame Andy Warhol spoke about. So it's all the more refreshing when not one but two excellent examples of the celebrity bio turn up at the same time and on subjects who have attained real and lasting fameDouglas and Katherine Hepburn. Douglas has written a candid and warm autobiography that shows a man who has never forgotten where he came from nor ceased to be grateful for what he has attained. The son of a Jewish immigrant, Douglas fought brutal poverty and prejudice to make his own way through college and into acting. His book is full of wonderful celebrity anecdotes and insider's details on a Hollywood that has now disappeared. More importantly, Douglas shares surprising vulnerability and insight, which belie his hard-jawed image. Much has already been written about Hepburn, but what sets Andersen's biography apart is that she is only a featured player in the story of her childhood: Her parents are the stars. In fact, Hepburn herself asserts that compared to her mother and father she is dull. Her mother was an early feminist and a cofounder of Planned Parenthood and the League of Women Voters, her father a pioneering physician in the field of venereal disease. Hepburn herself cooperated on this book and her quotes are interspersed. Two of the finest of their genre this year. Rosellen Brewer, Monterey Cty.

The Little Book of Letting Go is a treasure trove of practical and spiritual wisdom with gentle exercises and wonderful insights to help deliver us into the precious present, alive and grateful for the gift of life.</p><p>Bestselling author Hugh Prather has a knack for putting his finger on the pulse of America's emotional and spiritual angst. In <i>The Little Book of Letting Go</i> he gives voice to the internal chatter that prevents us from enjoying or pursuing our true desires. "Within our human heart we all feel the call to be simple, to be present, to be real," Prather writes. "Yet throughout the day, the world urges us to be at war with ourselves and each other: 'Be resentful about the past.' 'Be anxious about the future.' 'Be dissatisfied with what you do see.' 'Be guilty.' 'Be important.' 'Be bored.'" Prather compares these thoughts to the stale clutter in the back of our refrigerators. By cleaning out our minds, we allow room for fresher and more nourishing foods for thought.<p> In this little book on mental cleansing, Prather uses personal stories as well as step-by-step exercises to help readers understand the rewards and the process of letting go. For example, in the section on letting go of guilt and hurtful actions, Prather suggests that for at least one day readers "rise from sleep and make your purpose only this: 'I will go through this day harmlessly. I will hurt no one in my thoughts or in my actions, including myself.'" Prather includes numerous similar kinds of assignments in all of his chapters, including how to let go of..."Mental Pollutants," "Misery," "Prediction and Control," and "Spiritual Specialness." <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Hugh Prather has over thirty years experience of conducting self-esteem workshops, he is the author of Notes to Myself.</p><h2>Bruce Lee&#39;s Fighting Method Basic Training, Vol. 2</h2><p>Reveals how the iconic warrior attained his legendary speed, power, and footwork.

This anthology focuses in particular on the growing presence of Asian Americans as makers of independent films and cross-over successes. Essays of film criticism and interviews with film makers emphasize matters of cultural agency that is, the practices through which Asian American actors, directors, and audience members have shaped their own cinematic images. One of the anthology&#39;s key contributions is to trace the evolution of Asian American independent film practice over thirty years.Essays on the Japanese American internment and historical memory, essays on films by women and queer artists, and the reflections of individual film makers discuss independent productions as subverting or opposing the conventions of commercial cinema. But &#34;Countervisions&#34; also resists simplistic readings of &#39;mainstream&#39; film representations of Asian Americans and enumerations of negative images. Writing about Hollywood stars Anna May Wong and Nancy Kwan, director Wayne Wang, and erotic films, several contributors probe into the complex and ambivalent responses of Asian American audiences to stereotypical roles and commerical success. Taken together, the spirited, illuminating essays in this collection offer an unprecedented examination of a flourishing cultural production.Darrell Y.

Gorgeous, sharp, and anything but shy, Chelsea loves men and lots of them. <em>My Horizontal Life</em> chronicles her romp through the different bedrooms of a variety of suitors, a no-holds-barred account of what can happen between a man and a sometimes very intoxicated, outgoing woman during one night of passion. From her short fling with a Vegas stripper to her even shorter dalliance with a well-endowed little person, from her uncomfortable tryst with a cruise ship performer to her misguided rebound with a man who likes to play leather dress-up, Chelsea recalls the highs and lows of her one-night stands with hilarious honesty. <br><br>Encouraged by her motley collection of friends (aka: her partners in crime) but challenged by her family members (who at times find themselves a surprise part of the encounter), Chelsea hits bottom and bounces back, unafraid to share the gritty details. <em>My Horizontal Life</em> is one guilty pleasure you won't be ashamed to talk about in the morning.<br></p><p>Chelsea Handler was born in Livingston, New Jersey, and has toured the country doing stand-up. Now settled in Los Angeles, she can be seen at the Comedy Store and the Laugh Factory, and as one of the stars on Oxygen's Girls Behaving Badly. Chelsea has guest-starred on programs such as Spy TV, My Wife and Kids, The Bernie Mac Show, and The Practice. Her stand-up will soon be televised on VH1's Love Lounge, Comedy Central's Premium Blend, and HBO's broadcast of the Aspen Comedy Festival.<br>Opening with a cute story from when she was seven and photographed her parents having sex, stand-up comedian Handler goes on to discuss the virtues of the one-night stand, which amount to having sex early enough so you're not months into a relationship before you discover he's into "anal beads and duct tape." She discusses her quest for sex with a "black man," which doesn't work out because the date she finds on ChocolateSingles.com has a penis so large, she "would have had to be the size of the Lincoln Tunnel to accommodate that thing." After him, there's a "little midget," but she sobers up before sleeping with him. Next come a number of would-be partners with penises too small to consider. Finally, there's a guy Handler <i>does</i> sleep with, only an embarrassing incident involving a "giant skid mark" prevents her from seeing him again. By the end, Handler considers settling down with one man, which might actually net her more sex than these mostly unconsummated one-night stands. Anyone who laughs at the mere mention of vaginas and penises may find Handler's book almost as much fun as getting drunk and waking up in some stranger's bed. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For Carla Hall, co-host of &#x2019;s The Chew, food is a wonderful way to forge connections with and between people.

Spinning standbys into distinctive new recipes, she combines the beloved flavors of home with the most delectable, enticing spices and tastes of international cuisine. Carla starts with your essential recipe for perfect all-American burgers; from there, you can choose to do them up Persian-style with Cucumber Yogurt Sauce, lime, and fragrant spices; or give them a Vietnamese twist with pickled veggies, scallions, ginger, and cilantro; or take your burgers to Morocco with gutsy spices, chiles, and feta cheese.

The next year, Tom Kite, the game's all-time leading money winner won the US Open at Pebble Beach. In 1995, Corey Pavin finally broke through and won his first major championship, the US Open at Shinnecock Hills, Long Island. What do these three players have in common? Their teacher is Chuck Cook, one of the sharpest minds in golf instruction today.<br>Chuck Cook is equally successful whether he is working with U.S. Open champions or rank beginners. What is his secret? He is not a method teacher--in other words, he doesn't give all his students the same medicine for their golfing ills. Instead, he works differently with each individual. But the one constant to his approach is the concept of Balance. In <i>Perfectly Balanced Golf</i> Cook strives to bring every golfer a balanced point in their swings, in their short games and in their mental outlooks.<br>Kite, Stewart and Pavin have placed their entire golf games--and their careers--in Chuck's able hands and each has contributed a thoughtful foreword to the book.</p><p></p><h2>El �nico destino (The Only Road) (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>PURA BELPR� HONOR BOOK<br> ALA NOTABLE BOOK<br> <br>&#x201c;Powerful and timely.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br> &#x201c;An important, must-have addition to the growing body of literature with immigrant themes.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>School Library Journal</i> (starred review)<br> <br>En esta absorbente y emocionante novela juvenil, Jaime de doce a�os emprende el peligroso y traicionero viaje que le transforma su vida de su hogar en Guatemala a Estados Unidos para vivir con su hermano mayor.<br> <br>Twelve-year-old Jaime makes the treacherous and life-changing journey from his home in Guatemala to live with his older brother in the United States in this gripping and realistic middle grade novel.<br><br>Jaime est� sentado en su cama dibujando cuando oye un grito.

It's the only current, comprehensive guide to working with cabochons--a flat piece of rock or mineral--and it covers all the basics, along with a range of new creative techniques and hot trends. Find out which tools and materials to use, which beads work best, and how to wrap them round the stones. Craft turned, pointed, twisted, brick stitch, ruffled, or scalloped edges, or add decorative fringe. For something dramatic, combine more than one cabochon in a single piece. Or, instead of natural stone, use dichroic glass or other found objects. Make a glittering brooch, funky bracelets, a wearable art necklace, and other showstoppers.<br><br></p><p><b>Praise for Jamie Cloud Eakin's <i>Beading with Cabochons</i>: </b>&nbsp;"The designs are all beautiful and have a dramatic neo-Victorian look. Highly recommended." - <b>Library Journal</b><b></b>&nbsp;"<i>Beading With Cabochons</i> by Jamie Cloud Eakin is the first book (on bead embroidery) I read, and it's my favorite guide to beading around flat-backed stones for several reasons. One, she takes you through every step of the beading process, from gluing down the stone to attaching the backing, in detail. Even nervous newcomers will feel confident. Two, she covers a number of edging and attachment techniques to take a reader from beginner to intermediate. And three, she goes beyond the projects in her book and discusses designing your own -- essential for the bead embroidery artist! Note: Her technique for creating beaded bezels is different from the other technique I've seen, which is to create bezels out of circular peyote stitch. You may find it worthwhile to learn both ways!" - <b>Saturday Sequins blog</b>, March 2012With the joy of beading spreading, it's odd that no one artist has chosen to focus on a singular type of beading technique. Now, California artist Eakin takes the cabochon--a jewel or bead with a flat back and smooth dome surface--as her sole subject. In fact, it yields much more robust content that one might think at first. Tools and materials, as expected, resemble generic beading equipment, but the techniques differ in process and complexity. Framing the bead alone requires mastery of six steps; then edging can assume a variety of styles, from plane-raw to scalloped. Eakin uses a host of sidebars to encourage experimentation and includes 11 well--photographed projects with good instructions (an oval solitaire rhodonite bracelet, for one, with others featuring semiprecious gems such as jasper, onyx, agate, Malaysian jade, and tigereye). <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

At once a self-styled social scientist, a spy in the baffling adult world surrounding him, and a budding, hormone-driven emotional explorer, Oliver is stealthily (and perhaps a bit more nervously than he&#x2019;d ever admit) nosing his way forward through the murky and uniquely perilous waters of adolescence. His objectives? Uncovering the secrets behind his parents&#x2019; teetering marriage, unraveling the mystery that is his alluring and equally quirky classmate Jordana Bevan, and understanding where he fits in among the pansexuals, Zoroastrians, and other mystifying, fascinating beings in his orbit.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s in my interests to know about my parents&#x2019; mental problems,&#x201d; he reasons. Thus, when he discovers that his affable dad is quietly struggling with depression, Oliver marshals all the daytime-TV pop-psychology wisdom at his command&#x2013;not to mention his formidable, uninhibited powers of imagination&#x2013;in order to put things right again. But a covert expedition into the mysterious territory of middle-aged malaise is bound to be tricky business for a teenager with more to learn about the agonies and ecstasies of life than a pocket thesaurus and his &#x201c;worldly&#x201d; school chum Chips can teach him. <br><br>Ready or not, however, Oliver is about to get a crash course. His awkwardly torrid and tender relationship with Jordana is hurtling at the speed of teenage passion toward the inevitable magic moment . . . and whatever lies beyond. And his boy-detective exploits have set him on a collision course with the New Age old flame who&#x2019;s resurfaced in his mother&#x2019;s life to lead her into temptation with lessons in surfing, self-defense . . . and maybe seduction. Struggling to buoy his parents&#x2019; wedded bliss, deep-six his own virginity, and sound the depths of heartache, happiness, and the business of being human, what&#x2019;s a lad to do? Poised precariously on the cusp of innocence and experience, yesterday&#x2019;s daydreams and tomorrow&#x2019;s decisions, Oliver Tate aims to damn the torpedoes and take the plunge.</p><p>Joe Dunthorne was born and brought up in Swansea, South Wales. His poetry has been featured on Channel 4 and Radio 3; he has performed at festivals including Glastonbury, Hay-on-Wye, and Latitude. Now twenty-five, Dunthorne lives in London. <i>Submarine</i> is his first novel.Welsh-born Dunthorne delves in his debut into the mind of a troubled 14-year-old boy obsessed with his virginity, his parent's failing marriage and the dictionary. Growing up in Swansea, Wales, Oliver Tate is curious about everything going on around him. Fixated on the personal lives of his parents and neighbors, Oliver compulsively keeps a log of his observations, activities and thoughts, many of which revolve around his new girlfriend, Jordana, she of the fully developed breasts and snogging experience. The two become inseparable and eventually wind up together in the sack. Oliver also believes his mother is having an affair with a family friend, and his growing suspicion leads to a half-baked investigation that only complicates matters at home. As Oliver and Jordana's relationship plays out and the truth about Oliver's mother is revealed, Oliver takes some lumps and learns a few lessons. Some readers will be turned off by Oliver's cruelty&#x2014;among other things, he bullies an overweight girl at school and poisons Jordana's dog&#x2014;and others by his precociousness (his log entries include word-of-the-day vocab lessons), but Dunthorne's creation is a true original. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For readers interested in either [sculpture or poetry], this volume is a treat." &#x2014; <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i><br>During the early 1900s, the great German poet lived and worked in Paris with Auguste Rodin. In a work as revealing of its author as it is of his famous subject, Rainer Maria Rilke examines Rodin's life and work, and explains the often elusive connection between the creative forces that drive timeless literature and great art.<br>Rilke served for several years as Rodin's secretary &#x2014; living in the sculptor's workshops, watching the shaping of his creations, and discussing his views and ideas. Written in 1903 and 1907, these essays about the master's work and development as an artist mark Rilke's entry into the world of letters. Rodin himself paid the poet the ultimate tribute, declaring these meditations the supreme interpretation of his work. This excellent translation, complemented by 33 illustrations, will fascinate students of literature, philosophy, and art history.<br></p><p>� Over 100 drawings and cutouts <p>� Rodin shows the female nude form in its beauty and simplicity </p><p>� Wonderful collection of Rodin&#x2019;s late work</p>Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) is one of France&#x2019;s most revered artists. His works are distinguished by their stunning strength and realism. He was strongly influenced by the works of Michelangelo, and his pursuit of realism resulted in accusations that he had used a live model as a cast for his sculpture, The Age of Bronze. Among his most famous works are his monuments The Burghers of Calais, his statues St. John the Baptist Preaching, Eve, The Thinker, and The Kiss, and The Gates of Hell. In 1916 Rodin donated his entire estate to the French government stipulating that they establish a permanent museum dedicated to his work.

Monk, mystic, and brilliant philosopher, he shaped the trajectory of Tibetan Buddhism's Nyingma school.&nbsp; This introduction provides a most concise entr�e to this great luminary's life and work. The first section gives a general context for understanding this remarkable individual who, though he spent the greater part of his life in solitary retreat, became one of the greatest scholars of his age. Part Two gives an overview of Mipam's interpretation of Buddhism, examining his major themes, and devoting particular attention to his articulation of the Buddhist conception of emptiness. Part Three presents a representative sampling of Mipam's writings.</p><p>Jamgon Mipam (1846-1912) was one of the great luminaries of Tibetan Buddhism in modern times. He had a dominant and vitalizing influence on the Nyingma school and beyond. A scholar of outstanding brilliance and versatility, his translated works are eagerly anticipated by English-language readers.&#x201c;At last, a comprehensive study of Mipam, the Nyingma Lion, whose magisterial works bridged the scholastic and yogic traditions of Tibet. Beautifully written, Duckworth&#x2019;s book lucidly surveys Mipam&#x2019;s Buddhist philosophy and provides translated excerpts from Mipam&#x2019;s voluminous body of work that illustrate his erudite views.

I congratulate my student, Prof. Douglas Duckworth, for publishing this important book on the life and works of the great scholar-practitioner, and I believe the book will be of interest, not only to students of Tibetan Buddhism, but to anyone with a sincere interest in discovering the depths of Buddhist insight.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ch�kyi Nyima Rinpoche, author of<i> Present Fresh Wakefulness: A Meditation Manual on Nonconceptual Wisdom </i> <br><br>&#x201c;Douglas Duckworth gives historical background to important Buddhist discussions in India and Tibet that concerned Mipam, a survey of the philosophical themes that he addressed and a selection of translations from his impressive array of writings. Though the translations are excerpts from longer works, they are valuable reading for practitioners. As a condensed anthology on Mipam, this book strikes an important balance, explaining the thought of one of Tibet&#x2019;s great intellectuals while giving readers handpicked gems from Mipam&#x2019;s forest of wisdom.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Buddhadharma </i></p><h2>Humility (Pure Gold Classics)</h2><p>This is a marvelous book about humility!

Murray began writing on the Christian life for his congregation as an extension of his local pastoral work, but he became internationally known for his books, such as With Christ in the School of Prayer and Abide in Christ, that searched men's hearts and brought them into a deep relationship with Christ. Writing with an intensity of purpose and zeal for the message of the gospel, Murray wrote numerous books even after his "retirement" at age seventy&#x2013;eight.</p><h2>Tai Pan</h2><p>Set in the turbulent days of the founding of Hong Kong in the 1840s, &#34;Tai-Pan&#34; is the story of Dirk Struan, the ruler - the Tai-Pan - of the most powerful trading company in the Far East.

After the war Clavell worked in the film industry producing a number of successful films including To Sir with Love. He died in 1994.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>"A pox on this stinking island," Brock said, staring around the beach and up at the mountains. "The whole of China at our feets and all we takes be this barren, sodding rock."<br><br>He was standing on the foreshore with two of his fellow China traders. Scattered about them were other clusters of traders, and officers from the expeditionary force. They were all waiting for the Royal Navy officer to begin the ceremony. An honor guard of twenty marines was drawn up in two neat lines beside the flagpole, the scarlet of their uniforms a sudden splash of color. Near them were the untidy knots of sailors who had just fought the flagpole into the stony soil.<br><br>"Eight bells were time to raise the flag," Brock said, his voice rasping with impatience. "It be an hour past. Wot's godrotting delay for?"<br><br>"It's bad joss to curse on a Tuesday, Mr. Brock," Jeff Cooper said. He was a lean, hook-nosed American from Boston, his frock coat black and his felt top hat set at a jaunty angle. "Very bad!"<br>Cooper's partner, Wilf Tillman, stiffened slightly, feeling the underlying edge to the younger man's nasal voice. He was thickset and ruddy, and came from Alabama.<br><br>"I'll tell thee right smartly, this whole godrotting flyspeck be bad joss!" Brock said. "Joss" was a Chinese word that meant Luck and Fate and God and the Devil combined. "Godrotting bad."<br><br>"It better not be, sir," Tillman said. "The future of the China trade's here now&#x2014;good joss or bad joss."<br><br>Brock stared down at him. "Hong Kong's got no future. It's open ports on the China mainland we be needing, and you knowed it, by God!"<br><br>"The harbor's the best in these waters," Cooper said. "Plenty of room to careen and refit all our ships. Plenty of room to build our homes and warehouses. And no Chinese interference at long last."<br><br>"A colony's got to have arable land and peasants to work the land, Mr. Cooper. An' revenue," Brock said impatiently. "I be walking all over and so have you. Not a crop'll grow here. There be no fields or streams, no grazing land. So no meat and no spuds. Everything we be needing'll have to come by sea. Think of the cost. Why, even the fishing be rotten. An' who's to pay upkeep of Hong Kong, eh? Us and our trade, by God!"<br><br>"Oh, that's the sort of colony you want, Mr. Brock?" Cooper said. "I thought the British Empire"&#x2014;he spat deftly to windward&#x2014;"had enough of that sort of colony."<br><br>Brock's hand strayed near his knife. "Be you spitting to clear yor throat, or spitting on the Empire?" Tyler Brock was nearing fifty, a big, one-eyed man as hard and as permanent as the iron he had been forced to peddle in Liverpool as a youth, and as strong and as dangerous as the fighting merchant ships he had escaped to and at length had come to rule as head of Brock and Sons. His clothes were rich and the knife at his belt was jeweled. His beard was graying like his hair.<br><br>"It's a cold day, Mr. Brock," Tillman said quickly, inwardly angry at his young partner's loose tongue. Brock was no man to bait, and they could not afford open enmity with him yet. "Plenty of chill on the wind, eh, Jeff?"<br><br>Cooper nodded briefly. But he did not take his eyes off Brock. He had no knife, but there was a derringer in his pocket. He was of a height with Brock but slighter, and unafraid.<br><br>"I be givin' thee piece of advice, Mr. Cooper," Brock said. "Best not spit too often after saying 'British Empire.' There be some wot baint be givin' thee benefit of doubt."<br><br>"Thank you, Mr. Brock, I'll remember," Cooper replied easily. "And I'll give you some advice: It's bad joss to curse on a Tuesday."<br><br>Brock suppressed his temper. Eventually he would crush Cooper and Tillman and their company, the biggest of the American traders. But now he needed them as allies against Dirk and Robb Struan. Brock cursed joss. Joss had made Struan and Company the greatest house in Asia, and so rich and powerful that the other China traders had named it in awe and jealousy The Noble House&#x2014;noble because it was first in riches, first in largess, first in trade, first in clippers, but mostly because Dirk Struan was Tai-Pan, the Tai-Pan among all the tai-pans of Asia. And joss had cost Brock an eye seventeen years ago, the year that Struan had founded his empire.<br><br>It had happened off Chushan Island. Chushan was just south of the huge port of Shanghai, near the mouth of the mighty Yangtse River. Brock had beaten up through the monsoon with a huge cargo of opium&#x2014;Dirk Struan a few days astern, also carrying opium. Brock had reached Chushan first, sold his cargo and turned around, knowing happily that now Struan would have to go farther north and try a new coast with fresh risks. Brock had sped south for home&#x2014;Macao&#x2014;his coffers filled with bullion, the full wind astern. Then a great storm had suddenly swooped out of the China seas. The Chinese called these storms tai-fung, the Supreme Winds. The traders called them typhoons. They were terror incarnate.<br><br>The typhoon had battered Brock's ship mercilessly, and he had been pinned by the falling masts and spars. A shorn halyard, caught by the winds, had flailed him as he lay helpless. His men had cut him loose but not before the broken shackle-ended rope had gouged out his left eye. The ship had been on her beam ends and he helped them cut the rigging and spars adrift, and by some miracle she had righted herself. Then he had poured brandy into the bleeding socket; he could still remember the pain.<br><br>And he recalled how he had limped into port long after he had been given up for lost, his fine three-masted clipper no more than a hulk, the seams sprung, masts and guns and rigging gone. And by the time Brock had replaced spars and rigging and masts and cannon and powder and shot and men, and bought another cargo of opium, all the profits of this voyage had vanished.<br><br>Struan had run into the same typhoon in a small lorcha&#x2014;a boat with a Chinese hull, English-rigged and used for coastal smuggling in fine weather. But Struan rode out the storm and, elegant and untouched as usual, had been on the dock to greet Brock, his strange green eyes mocking him.<br><br>Dirk and his cursed joss, Brock thought. Joss be letting Dirk build that one stinking lorcha into a fleet of clippers and hundreds of lorchas, into warehouses and bullion to spare. Into godrotting Noble House. Joss pushed Brock and Sons into godrotting second place. Second. And, he thought, joss's given him ear of our godrotting weak-gutted plenipotentiary, the Honorable Godrotting Longstaff, all these years. An' now, together, they've sold us out. "A&nbsp; pox on Hong Kong and a pox on Struan!"<br>"If it weren't for Struan's plan, you'd never have won your war so easily," Cooper said.<br><br>The war had begun at Canton two years before, when the Chinese emperor, determined to bring the Europeans to heel, tried to eliminate the opium smuggling which was essential to British trade. Viceroy Ling had surrounded the foreign settlement at Canton with troops, and demanded every case of opium in Asia to ransom the lives of the defenseless English traders. At length, twenty thousand cases of opium had been given over and destroyed, and the British were allowed to retreat to Macao. But the British could not take lightly either interference with its trade or threats to its nationals. Six months ago the British Expeditionary Force had arrived in the Orient and ostensibly had been placed under the jurisdiction of Longstaff, the Captain Superintendent of Trade.<br><br>But it was Struan who conceived the inspired plan to by-pass Canton, where all the trouble had started, and instead send the expeditionary force north to Chushan. To take that island without loss would be simple, Struan had theorized, for the Chinese were unprepared and helpless against any modern European army or fleet. Leaving a small holding force at Chushan and a few ships to blockade the Yangtse, the expeditionary force could sail north to the mouth of the Pei Ho River and threaten Peking, the capital of China, which was only a hundred miles upstream. Struan knew that only so direct a threat would make the emperor immediately sue for peace. A superb conception. And it had worked brilliantly. The expeditionary force had arrived in the Orient last June. By July Chushan had been taken. By August it was moored at the Pei Ho. In two weeks the emperor had sent an official to negotiate peace&#x2014;the first time in history that any Chinese emperor had officially acknowledged any European nation. And the war had ended with almost no loss to either side.<br><br>"Longstaff was very wise to follow the plan," Cooper said.<br><br>"Any China trader knowed how to bring the Chinee to their knees," Brock said, his voice rough. He pushed his top hat farther back on his forehead and eased his eye patch. "But why did Longstaff and Struan agree to negotiate back at Canton, eh? Any fool knowed 'negotiate' to a Chinee means to play for time. We should've stayed north at the Pei Ho till peace were signed. But no, we brung back the fleet and for the last six month we be waiting and waiting for the buggers to set pen to paper." Brock spat. "Stupid, crazy stupid. An' all that waste of time and money for this stinking rock. We should've kept Chushan. Now, there be island worth having." Chushan was twenty miles long and ten wide and its land fertile and rich&#x2014;a good port and a big city, Tinghai. "Space for a man to breathe in there, right enough. Why, from there three or four frigates can blockade the Yangtse at the drop of a topper. An' who controls that river controls the heart of China. That's where we should settle, by God."<br><br>"You still have Chushan, Mr. Brock."<br><br>"Yus. But it baint deeded in godrotting treaty, so it baint our'n." He stamped his feet against the growing chill wind.<br><br>"Perhaps you should mention it to Longstaff," Cooper said. "He's susceptible to advice."<br><br>"Not to mine, he baint. As thee rightly knowed. But I'll tell thee, when Parliament hear about the treaty, there be hell to pay, I'll be bound."<br><br>Cooper lit a cheroot. "I'm inclined to agree. It is an astonishing piece of paper, Mr. Brock. For this day and age. When every European power is land-_grabbing and power-hungry."<br><br>"And I suppose the United States baint?" Brock's face tightened. "Wot about yor Indians? The Louisiana Purchase? Spanish Florida? You be havin' eyes on Mexico and Russian Alaska. The last mails told you be even trying to steal Canada. Eh?"<br><br>"Canada's American, not English. We're not going to war over Canada&#x2014;she'll join us of her own free will," Cooper said, hiding his worry. He tugged at his muttonchop whiskers and pulled his frock coat tighter around his shoulders against the sharpening wind. He knew that war with the British Empire would be disastrous at this time, and would ruin Cooper-Tillman. God damn wars. Even so, he knew that the States would have to go to war over Mexico and Canada unless there was a settlement. Just as Britain had had to go to war with China.<br><br>"There won't be a war," Tillman said, trying to quiet Cooper diplomatically. He sighed and wished himself back in Alabama. A man can be a gentleman there, he thought. There you don't have to deal with the damned British every day, or with blasphemous, foulmouthed scum like Brock, or a devil incarnate like Struan&#x2014;or even with an impetuous young man and senior partner like Jefferson Cooper, who thinks Boston the center of the earth. "And this war's over, for better or worse."<br><br>"Mark my words, Mr. Tillman," Brock said. "This godrotting treaty be no good for us'n and no good for they. We've to keep Chushan and open ports on mainland China. We be at war again in a few weeks. In June when the wind be ripe and the weather be ripe, the fleet'll have to sail north to Pei Ho again. An' if we be at war again, how we going to get season's teas and silks, eh? Last year almost no trade because of war&#x2014;the year before no trade at all an' they stole all our opium to boot. Eight thousand cases from me alone. Two million taels of silver that cost me. Cash."<br><br>"That money's not lost," Tillman said. "Longstaff ordered us to give it up. To ransom our lives. He gave us paper on the British Government. And there's a settlement in the treaty. Six million taels of silver to pay for it."<br><br>Brock laughed harshly. "Thee think Parliament be honoring Longstaff's paper? Why, any Government'd be throwed out of office the moment they asked for the brass to pay for opium. An' as to the six million&#x2014;that be paying for the cost of the war. I knowed Parliament better'n you. Kiss yor half million taels goodbye be my advice to you both. So if we be at war again this year, there be no trade again. An' if we baint trading this year, we be all bankrupt. You, me, every China trader. An' even the godrotting Noble House." He jerked out his watch. The ceremony was to have started an hour ago. Time be running out, he thought. Yus, but not on Brock and Sons, by God. Dirk's had seventeen-year run of good joss, and now be time for change.<br><br>Brock reveled in the thought of his second son, Morgan, who capably&#x2014;and ruthlessly&#x2014;controlled all their interests in England. He wondered if Morgan had been successful in undermining Struan's influence in Parliament and in banking circles. We be going to wreck thee, Dirk, he thought, and Hong Kong along with thee. "Wot the hell be the delay for?" he said, hastening toward the naval officer who was striding up and down near the marines.<br><br>"What's the matter with you, Jeff? You know he's right about Hong Kong," Tillman said. "You ought to know better than to bait him."<br><br>Cooper smiled his thin smile. "Brock's so goddam sure of himself. I couldn't help it."<br><br>"If Brock's right about the half million taels, we're ruined."<br><br>"Yes. But Struan will lose ten times that if there's no payment. He'll get paid, never fear. So we'll get ours." Cooper looked after Brock. "Do you think he knows about our deal with Struan?"<br><br>Tillman shrugged. "I don't know. But Brock's right about the treaty. It's stupid. It'll cost us a pretty penny."<br><br>For the last three months Cooper-Tillman had been acting as secret agents for The Noble House. British warships had been blockading Canton and the Pearl River, and British traders were forbidden to trade. Longstaff&#x2014;at Struan's bidding&#x2014;had put the embargo on as another measure to force the peace treaty, knowing that the Canton warehouses were bulging with teas and silks. But since America had not declared war on China, American ships could go through the blockade freely and thumb their noses at the warships. So Cooper-Tillman had bought four million pounds of tea from Chen-tse Jin Arn&#x2014;or Jin-qua, as he was nicknamed&#x2014;the richest of the Chinese merchants, and shipped it to Manila, supposedly for Spanish merchants. The local Spanish official, for a considerable bribe, had issued the necessary import and export licenses, and the tea was transferred&#x2014;duty free&#x2014;into Struan's clippers and rushed to England. Payment to Jin-qua was a shipload of opium delivered secretly by Struan somewhere up the coast.</p><h2>A History of Philosophy, Vol. 9: Maine De Biran to Sartre, Part 1: The Revolution to Henry Bergson</h2><p>A history of modern philosophy compiled by Frederick Copleston.</p><p></p><h2>Scouting the Divine Workbook: Searching for God in Wine, Wool and Wild Honey</h2><p>It&#39;s easy to feel disconnected from the agricultural lifestyle of Bible days.

Stout</b> is the Jonathan Edwards Professor of American Religious History at Yale University and the author of <i>The New England Soul</i>. He has received an NEH Research Fellowship and a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, among other awards. Currently the editor of the twenty-seven volume series of <i>The Works of Jonathan Edwards</i>, Professor Stout has coedited the seventeen-volume series <i>Religion and American Life</i> designed for public schools.<i>Starred Review.</i> In the Civil War, Union and Confederate soldiers alike marched to battle believing God was on their side. Stout, professor of American religious history at Yale (<i>The New England Soul</i>), artfully and eloquently examines the evolving rhetoric of warfare, both Northern and Confederate, within the rubric of "the just war" theory of conflict. Stout dissects such public documents as editorials, sermons and speeches, and private documents like diaries and letters, to trace the trajectory of both sides' rationales for war. But he also makes clear that most high-minded utterances obscured, rather than clarified, the economic issues that lay at the heart of the conflict. Stout argues that even today the moral justifications for the carnage ring louder than do the sordid dollar-and-cents realities that underlay sectional differences. As Stout shows, the Civil War remains with us today as an exercise of civil religion: altars of the two conflicting faiths stand side-by-side at Gettysburg and other venues, sacralized slices of patriotism painted in shades of gray or blue. Stout's contention that even the North engaged in immoral acts in prosecuting the war will rattle many, but the questions he raises are important in an era when humanitarian justifications for war are increasingly common. 24 b&amp;w illus., 5 maps, not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>(On sale Jan. 23)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this book one of the world&#39;s premier Bible teachers, N. T. Wright, reminds us that what matters is not so much our faith itself as Who our faith is in. Faith, says Wright, is like a window. The point is not for part of the wall to be made of glass. The point of a window is to allow us to see through it--and let light into the room! Faith allows us to see our situation and our own weakness in light of God who is powerful, holy and loving. Wright also looks at the character of the faith God calls us to. He unfolds how dependence, humility and mystery all have a role to play. God beckons us to lean on him as we seek to be constructive citizens of the world, to speak truth in love without hypocrisy and to risk submitting to one another in love. Wright doesn&#39;t ignore the messiness and difficulties of life, when hard times come and the unexpected knocks us down. He opens to us what faith means in times of trial and even in the face of death. Through it all he reminds us, it&#39;s not great faith we need: it is faith in a great God.</p><p>A prolific writer of both scholarly and popular books, N. T. Wright has written over thirty books, including <em>Simply Christian, The Original Jesus, What Saint Paul Really Said, The Challenge of Jesus, The Meaning of Jesus, Jesus and the Victory of God</em> and the magisterial <em>Paul and the Faithfulness of God</em>. His N. T. Wright For Everyone Series includes commentaries covering the entire New Testament. Formerly bishop of Durham in England, Wright is research professor of New Testament and early Christianity at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He was formerly canon theologian of Westminster Abbey and dean of Lichfield Cathedral. He also taught New Testament studies for twenty years at Cambridge, McGill and Oxford Universities. He has been a visiting professor at Harvard Divinity School, Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Gregorian University in Rome and many other institutions around the world. In addition to his many books, Wright reaches a broad audience through his frequent media appearances. A sought-after commentator, Wright writes frequently for newspapers in England, including the <em>Times, the Independent</em> and the <em>Guardian.</em> He has been interviewed numerous times by radio and television broadcasters on both sides of the Atlantic, including ABC, NBC, CNN, PBS and NPR."N. T. Wright reminds us that Christian faith is neither a mere assent to certain facts nor a sentimental embrace of religious identity. Instead, Christian faith is always determined by its object. The size of our faith is not what matters, but the greatness of the God who has accepted us because of Christ's work on our behalf. This reissue of one of Wright's early works contains a message that may be more timely today than when it was first released in 1978." (Trevin Wax, Christianity Today, December 2010)<br><br>"Anchored solidly in Scripture, Wright's book is easy to read, using helpful illustrations and analogies to support his explanations. This will make fantastic small-group material . . . Recommend this book to everyone, but especially to group leaders, class teachers, and pastors."

"You will receive what now seems to be a large sum of money," Fred Koch cautioned. "It may either be a blessing or a curse." <br><br>Fred's legacy would become a blessing <i>and </i>a curse to his four sons-Frederick, Charles, and fraternal twins David and Bill-who in the ensuing decades fought bitterly over their birthright, the oil and cattle-ranching empire their father left behind in 1967. Against a backdrop of scorched-earth legal skirmishes, Charles and David built Koch Industries into one of the largest private corporations in the world-bigger than Boeing and Disney-and they rose to become two of the wealthiest men on the planet. <br><br>Influenced by the sentiments of their father, who was present at the birth of the John Birch Society, Charles and David have spent decades trying to remake the American political landscape and mainline their libertarian views into the national bloodstream. They now control a machine that is a center of gravity within the Republican Party. To their supporters, they are liberating America from the scourge of Big Government. To their detractors, they are political "contract killers," as David Axelrod, President Barack Obama's chief strategist, put it during the 2012 campaign.<br><br>Bill, meanwhile, built a multi-billion dollar energy empire all his own, and earned notoriety as an America's Cup-winning yachtsman, a flamboyant playboy, and as a litigious collector of fine wine and Western memorabilia. Frederick lived an intensely private life as an arts patron, refurbishing a series of historic homes and estates.<br><br>SONS OF WICHITA traces the complicated lives and legacies of these four tycoons, as well as their business, social, and political ambitions. No matter where you fall on the ideological spectrum, the Kochs are one of the most influential dynasties of our era, but so little is publicly known about this family, their origins, how they make their money, and how they live their lives.

She has written for the New Yorker, the New York Times, Slate and other publications. She is now at work on a biography of Ebe Hawthorne, sister of Nathaniel, for which she has received a Radcliffe Institute fellowship.<i>Starred Review.</i> Marshall's outstanding debut is a triple biography making clear that Margaret Fuller wasn't the only woman of substance in Transcendentalist circles in 19th-century Massachusetts. The Peabody sisters were bright, gifted, independent and influential; they knew a host of notables, from Abigail Adams to Ralph Waldo Emerson. Oldest sister Elizabeth, who according to Marshall helped start the Transcendentalist movement, ran a school with Bronson Alcott, who named his third daughter in her honor. Mary made a name for herself first as a teacher and writer, and as the wife of educational reformer Horace Mann, who founded Antioch College. Youngest sister Sophia was an artist whose work included illustrations for her husband, Nathaniel Hawthorne. Only Elizabeth, by all accounts the most intellectual of the sisters, never married, though she was in love with both Hawthorne and Mann before either man fell for her sisters&#x2014;the bonds among the three survived, but they were, in Marshall's words, "prone to covert rivalries and shifting alliances." Marshall has distilled 20 years of research into a book that brings the sisters to life, along with their extended family and friends, and the time in which they matured: a time, Marshall notes, that allowed women to be on a more equal footing than they would enjoy later in the century. The only problem is that her book ends far too soon, covering barely the first half of the sisters' lives, the half the author finds more creative and illuminating. 57 b&amp;w illus. <i>Agent, Katinka Matson.</i><i>(Apr. 13)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Complete and unrestrained sharing of self exposes the deepest human fear of being rejected for being ourselves. In <i>The Seven Levels of Intimacy,</i> Matthew Kelly both acknowledges and calms our fears, while teaching us how to move beyond them to experience the power of true intimacy. </p><p>Matthew reveals that each relationship is built upon a pattern of interaction. In the beginning stages, we rely on casual interactions, gaining familiarity by focusing on superficialities and facts. We grow closer and begin to share our opinions, learning to accept each other and embrace the growing relationship despite the difference in our experiences and viewpoints. Once our differences and opinions are shared and accepted, we feel safe enough to reveal our hopes, dreams, and feelings, developing trust. With this trust, we open ourselves and are able to share our legitimate needs, becoming liberated from carrying the burden of our real needs alone. At last, we are deeply intimate and both willing and able to reveal our deepest fears. We are beyond judgment and feel trust and acceptance. By moving through and building upon each level of intimacy, we find comfort and gain trust in our partners and ourselves until, by developing and deepening our intimacy within each level, we are able to fully open ourselves, finally opening to the possibility of truly being loved. It is through mastering the seven levels of intimacy that we will break through to fully experiencing love, commitment, trust, and happiness.</p><p><i>The Seven Levels of Intimacy</i> is a brilliant and practical guide to creating and sustaining intimacy, whether you are looking for a deeper sense of connection with your spouse, looking for more fulfillment in your relationship with your boyfriend or girlfriend, trying to improve your relationships with your children, or simply wondering what you should be looking for in a partner. </p><p>With profound insight and the use of powerful, everyday examples, Matthew Kelly explains how we can nurture the intimacy in our relationships. <i>The Seven Levels of Intimacy</i> redefines how we view our interactions with others. This new understanding leads us to successfully create the strong connections, deep joy, and lasting bonds that we all long for.</p></p><p><b>Matthew Kelly</b>, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Rhythm of Life</i>, has been captivating audiences around the world since his late teens. Over the past decade, more than three million people have attended his talks and seminars in over fifty countries. Kelly is the president of Beresford Consulting.A throwaway buzzword in pop psychology, intimacy remains a litmus test for the health of relationships and is something everyone should strive for, says Kelly, the bestselling author of The Rhythm of Life. "Intimacy is the one thing a person cannot live happily without," he writes. Since many people cling to the "pubescent notion" that intimacy and sex are synonymous, Kelly begins by talking about what intimacy is not-sex, common interests-and proffering up inspirational tidbits and oft heard motivational questions ("Who energizes you?" "Why do they energize you?" "How do you want to be remembered?") before hammering home the thesis of this book: intimacy is a "legitimate need." His seven levels of intimacy-clich�s; facts; opinions; hopes and dreams; feelings; faults, fears and failures; and legitimate needs-each get a chapter-length discussion. Kelly advocates openness-in communication, enduring pain, delaying gratification-and sprinkles in bits of spirituality in cajoling readers to foster intimacy, and, in turn, love and the meaning of life. "Life is about love. It's about whom you love and whom you hurt. Life's about how you love and hurt the people close to you." His view may seem simplistic, but Kelly's simple, direct prose and patient explanations will appeal to spiritual readers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in New York, NY.</p>Grade 3-5-- Drawing together the threads of Jewish folk literature from places as distant as Yemen and Eastern Europe, Morocco and Germany, and ranging over 15 centuries, Schwartz and Rush weave a rich tapestry that shows the diversity of Jewish culture. In this collection of 15 stories, Elijah and King Solomon rub shoulders with witches, goblins, and the fools of the town of Chelm. This is often a benevolent universe where gentle justice reigns. Young Chusham, for example, is loved in spite of his foolishness. The story of Og, the giant who takes refuge on the ark during the great flood, illustrates the value of cooperation and repaying kindness while demonstrating the rewards of honesty. Other stories show similarities to those from other traditions. A particularly moving tale tells of how a little bird persuades King Solomon of the cruelty and stupidity of building a palace of birds' beaks. In all, the language is simple and vivid, and the narrative moves along at a good pace. The generous amount of white space makes the book accessible to younger readers. Ten tales are accompanied by Shulevitz's bright, dramatic watercolor paintings. Storytellers of varying degrees of experience and ability will find this a particularly valuable resource. An excellent collection for reading aloud or alone, with selections that are not readily available in other sources. --Susan Giffard, Englewood Public Library, NJ<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Keepers of Life: Discovering Plants through Native American Stories and Earth Activities for Children</h2><p>Using Native American stories as a teaching tool to help children discover plants and their environment, a complete program of study in botany, plant ecology, and natural history of many North American plants focuses on environmental and stewardship issues. IP.</p><p>Joseph Bruchac, coauthor of The Keepers of the Earth series, is a nationally acclaimed Native American storyteller and writer who has authored more than 70 books of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry for adults and children. He lives in upstate New York. Michael J. Caduto is an award-winning author, master storyteller, poet, musician, educator, and ecologist.

Presented here are 18 Native American stories from such tribes as the Huron, Seneca, Cheyenne, Cherokee, Mandan, Inuit, Pueblo, and Osage, covering such topics as botany, plant ecology, and the natural history of North American plants and plantlike organisms. Following each story is advice for parents, teachers, naturalists, or camp counselors on holding a discussion, asking questions, doing related activities, and extending the experience (reading, growing plants, writing and acting out a story, establishing a compost heap, taking a field trip, etc.). There is also a guide for using the book and a glossary and pronunciation key to Native American words and proper names. <i>George Cohen</i></p><h2>Goethe: The Poet and the Age: Volume I: The Poetry of Desire (1749-1790) (GOETHE, THE POET OF THE AGE)</h2><p>In 1880 Nietzche observed that Goethe had been "not just a good and great man, but an entire culture." The author of <em>Faust</em>, of exquisite lyric poetry, and of a bewildering variety of other plays, novels, and poetry as well as treatises on botany and color theory, Goethe also excelled as an administrator in the cabinet of Carl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. Now, Nicholas Boyle has written the definitive biography of this extraordinary figure--indeed, <em>The Poet and the Age</em> is the first full-length, original English-language biography of Goethe in sixty years.<br> In this elegant and enjoyable first volume--the first of two projected books--Boyle captures the passions and poetry of the young Goethe, leading us up to the moment when the French Revolution shook the foundations of all of Europe. Boyle contends that, although Goethe was certainly as much a part of German social and political life as he was its cultural nucleus, there was no single "Age of Goethe." Instead, Goethe's life spanned a great divide in European history: half was spent under a monarchy, and half under a middle-class bureaucracy. The first forty years of Goethe's creative life, rendered by Boyle in captivating detail, saw the early conception of <em>Faust</em>, and Goethe's rise to literary fame on the heels of his bestselling sentimental novel <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em>, a book which captured the European imagination like no other before it. <em>Werther</em> became a fashion in a strikingly contemporary sense: impassioned readers imitated the clothing, the sentiments, and even the tragic suicide of the novel's young hero. Napoleon claimed to have read Goethe's book seven times, and years later Mary Shelley cited it as the first book read by the monster she created in <em>Frankenstein</em>. Boyle provides not only close and provocative readings of Goethe's literary works, but also a vivid portrayal of a convulsive age of revolution, including insights into Weimar court life, and accounts of other master thinkers like Lessing and Schiller.<br> Part social history, part literary criticism, this is biography on a grand scale--as sweeping and magnificent as the life it portrays. Boyle's work is accessible to anyone, and does not assume a prior knowledge of German history or literature, but it is also rigorous and original--a major work of scholarship.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> Nicholas Boyle is University Lecturer in German and Fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge. A Goethe specialist, Boyle has written extensively on German and French literature and philosophy.<br>`THE first volume of Nicholas Boyle's Goethe: The Poet and the Age promises well for the second and the complete work will doubtless rank among the few important English books on Goethe to appear since 1949,...This is an enjoyable , erudite book for which the scholars and students whom he addresses will be grateful. It contains a full index and notes and thirty-seven well-chosen illustrations. Translations are given of all German passages cited. We look forward to volume II.' K.G.

That this is undoubtedly so is ... a tribute to the meticulous and scholarly way in which Boyle has gathered and arranged his material ... in this volume Boyle has not only laid a sound foundation for the understanding of Goethe's prodigious output in the second half of his life; he has provided an immensely informative overview of the intellectual and cultural context of Goethe's early career and a readable and authoritative account of his personal and literary development up to and including the Italian Journey.' Forum for Modern Language Studies, Volume XXIX No. 3, July 1993<br><br>'This is the first volume of what will surely be the most comprehensive and authorititative biography of Goethe in English. Boyle's record of the first forty years of Goethe's life is minutely detailed, but also establishes a firmly structured profile of his work and his creative personality in a dense but lucid account of the poet's personal and public relations. Boyle's sober account of the life and works is not without moments of humour, even hilarity. Boyle also provides an exhaustive account in breadth and depth of the Age in which and, more often than not, against which Goethe's genius asserted itself.' John R.

Then there was the Little Mermaid. Today, thanks to Jim Toomey, it's <i>Sherman's Lagoon</i>, a satirical, sea-floor look at popular culture as showcased through the lives of a lovable shark and his waterborne cronies. Sherman's the somewhat dim-witted but happy-go-lucky shark who takes us for a wonderful ride beneath the waves. This Jaws-less jokester teams up with a veritable school of bottom-dwelling denizens to deliver one of the funniest creations on land or sea. With an imaginative storyline and creatively rendered characters, <i>Sherman's Lagoon</i> has captured a considerable following.<br><br> Sherman&#x2014;who never allows thinking to interfere with life's simple pleasures, especially eating&#x2014;is joined by Fillmore, his trusty turtle sidekick; Megan, his significant shark other; Hawthorne, the irascible hermit crab; and a host of other Neptunian neighbors occupying the lagoon of an imaginary South Pacific island called Kapupu.<br><br> In <i>Sherman's Lagoon: Ate That, What's Next?</i>, this cast of coral reef critters never fails to amuse. Consider Sherman opening a wrapped holiday gift box only to find a putrid dead fish&#x2014;and loving it! Or the day he and Fillmore contemplate plunging to the deepest depths of the ocean, in order to recover Fillmore's fumbled Ninja Turtle Decoder Ring.

He was, as well, an intensely private man, and he authorized no biographies in his lifetime. Kate Buford is the first writer to win the cooperation of Lancaster's widow, close friends, and colleagues, and her book is a revelation.<br>Here is Lancaster the man, from his teenage years, bolting the Depression-era immigrant neighborhood of East Harlem where he grew up for the life of a circus acrobat -- then the electric New York theater of the 1930s, then the dying days of vaudeville. We see his production company -- Hecht-Hill-Lancaster -- become the biggest independent of the 1950s, a bridge between the studio era and modern filmmaking. With the power he derived from it we see him gain a remarkable degree of control, which he used to become the auteur of his own career. His navigation through the anti-Communist witch-hunts made him an example of a star who tweaked the noses of HUAC and survived. His greatest roles -- in <i>Sweet Smell of Success, Elmer Gantry, Birdman of Alcatraz, The Swimmer, Atlantic City</i> -- kept to the progressive edge that had originated in the tolerant, diverse, reforming principles of his childhood. And in the extraordinary complete roster of his films -- <i>From Here to Eternity, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Judgment at Nuremberg, The Leopard, 1900,</i> and <i>Field of Dreams,</i> among many others -- he proved to be both a master of commercial movies that pleased a worldwide audience and an actor who pushed himself beyond stardom into cinematic art. Kate Buford has written a dynamic biography of a passionate and committed star, the first full-scale study of one of the last great unexamined Hollywood lives.</p><p>If you have any serious interest in movies, you've got to read NPR pundit Kate Buford's sharp-eyed, meticulous, intelligent account of Burt Lancaster's life and work. The most inward of actors--director Luchino Visconti called him "the most <i>perfectly</i> mysterious man I ever met"--Lancaster spurned most press attention. Buford proves there was more to the No. 1 box-office star of <i>Elmer Gantry</i> and <i>From Here to Eternity</i> than muscles and big capped teeth. Growing up in Mob-ruled Harlem (Vincent "Mad Dog" Coll perpetrated the famous "baby massacre" on Lancaster's block), Lancaster ran off to the circus as an acrobat, went to war, and hit stardom at 33. <i>Sweet Smell of Success</i> cowriter Clifford Odets said there were seven Burts, including "Inscrutable Burt" and "Monster Golem Burt." He intimidated Montgomery Clift and Norman Mailer, threatened to toss his producer out a window, slugged Margot Kidder, put a girlfriend in the hospital by hurling her in the air just like his character in <i>Brute Force</i>, and made Kirk Douglas cry by mocking his elevator shoes. After he seduced costar Yvonne De Carlo in her mink coat (he also bedded Deborah Kerr and Marlene Dietrich), the mother of his five children comforted herself with innumerable minks and bottles of booze. His kids were neglected; the son whose baseball team Lancaster coached wrote <i>The Bad News Bears</i>, capturing Burt in the gruff Matthau character. <p> Buford notes that the seducer Gantry and control freak J.J. Hunsecker were closest to the real Burt, while the Birdman of Alcatraz was who he wanted to be. She takes us behind the scenes, showing precisely what the actor contributed (and threatened to undermine) in his great films, including his Oscar win as producer, <i>Marty</i>. Buford also explains how his independent film company anticipated many later trends but blew it by overspending on script development, and assesses his brilliant deconstruction of his own legend as the lion in winter of <i>Local Hero</i> and <i>Atlantic City</i>. And she puts all gossip in perspective. Burt's jealousy as he fumed in his car outside the house where his ex Shelley Winters was bedding Marlon Brando had a film-historical importance: Brando also stole Stanley Kowalski and the <i>Godfather</i> roles from Burt, and he represented the Method acting style Burt strenuously opposed for the first half of his career. Because he was too smart and curious to stick with one persona, and more interested in art than money, Lancaster needs a landmark biography. He's got one now. And you must check out his full-backside nudity on the back cover! <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"Outstanding. <b>Burt Lancaster: An American Life</b> sets a standard against which other Hollywood biographies can be measured."<br>-- Neal Gabler, author of <b>Life the Movie</b><br><p>"Lancaster is captured in all his complexity in <b>Burt Lancaster</b>. The book tells an extraordinary story of a kid from East Harlem who became a movie star in his first minutes onscreen.

A must for all Burt fans!"<br>--John Turturro<br></p><p>"[A] well-researched and engaging biography. . . . By carefully contextualizing Lancaster's more than 50-year career (which began in the circus and included such film classics as <i>From Here to Eternity</i> and <i>Elmer Gantry</i>) within the tumultuous political and economic changes of the postwar years, Buford's finely detailed, sensitive biography ranks among the best of its genre."<br> -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br></p><p>"<b>Burt Lancaster: An American Life</b> is a wonderful look into the complicated life and influences that made this extraordinary man and the times in which we live -- by understanding his beginnings and choices, we better understand ourselves. It reminded me that politics and art have always been intertwined and that celebrities who think independently and truly believe in the First Amendment can make a difference."<br>-- Susan Sarandon<br></p><p>"Kate Buford has done something remarkable with Burt Lancaster. She makes his childhood and circus days seem romantic and enviable. She shows him as a Hollywood giant, not always easy or nice to know. And then she brings him home as a great actor, sadder, wiser, but essential. The arc is all there -- just like Burt flying through the air -- but the book is as good as it is because she never denies the abiding mystery of the man."<br>-- David Thomson, author of <b>Biographical Dictionary of Film</b><br></p><p>"Kate Buford's <b>Burt Lancaster</b> is so beautifully written and reasoned that it transcends 'celebrity bio' on every page. It is a precisely observed and shrewdly insightful account of a life that turns out to be daunting in its achievements, haunting in its contradictions. Burt Lancaster was never more fascinating on the screen than he is in these pages. Buford's portrait of him is witty, compassionate, a helluva read, and -- I suspect -- definitive."<br>-- Steven Bach, author of <b>Final Cut</b></p></p><h2>The Twisted Ones (Exclusive Book) (Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s Series #2) Realese Date ( June 27 2017)</h2><p>The highly anticipated sequel to the bestselling Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: The Silver Eyes.

And yet, for twenty-five centuries, he has remained an enigma: a man who left no written legacy and about whom everything we know is hearsay, gleaned from the writings of Plato, Xenophon and Aristophanes. Now Bettany Hughes gives us an unprecedented, brilliantly vivid portrait of Socrates and of his homeland, Athens in its Golden Age.<br><br>His life spanned &#x201c;seventy of the busiest, most wonderful and tragic years in Athenian history.&#x201d; It was a city devastated by war, but, at the same time, transformed by the burgeoning process of democracy, and Hughes re-creates this fifth-century B.C. city, drawing on the latest sources&#x2014;archaeological, topographical and textual&#x2014;to illuminate the streets where Socrates walked, to place him there and to show us the world as he experienced it. <br><br>She takes us through the great, teeming Agora&#x2014;the massive marketplace, the heart of ancient Athens&#x2014;where Socrates engaged in philosophical dialogue and where he would be condemned to death. We visit the battlefields where he fought, the red-light district and gymnasia he frequented and the religious festivals he attended. We meet the men and the few women&#x2014;including his wife, Xanthippe, and his &#x201c;inspiration&#x201d; and confidante, Aspasia&#x2014;who were central to his life. We travel to where he was born and where he died. And we come to understand the profound influences of time and place in the evolution of his eternally provocative philosophy.<br><br>Deeply informed and vibrantly written, combining historical inquiry and storytelling �lan, <i>The Hemlock Cup</i> gives us the most substantial, fascinating, humane depiction we have ever had of one of the most influential thinkers of all time.</p><p><b>Bettany Hughes</b> is an award-winning historian, author and broadcaster.

In the Socratic Dialogues, generated twenty-four centuries ago, we find the birth of <i>ethos</i> &#x2013; ethics &#x2013; and the identification of the <i>psyche</i>. &#x2018;The First Martyr&#x2019; &#x2013; the Greek <i>martys</i> means &#x2018;witness&#x2019; &#x2013; a witness to &#x2018;truth, virtue, justice&#x2019; and &#x2018;freedom of speech&#x2019;, is commemorated as a bedrock of our civilisation. Socrates stands at the beginning of our world &#x2013; when democracy and liberty are first conceived as fundamental values of society. We need to understand him because he did not just pursue the meaning of life, but the meaning of our own lives.<br><br>Socrates sees us coming. He worries that the pursuit of plenty will bring mindless materialism, that &#x2018;democracy&#x2019; will become just a banner under which to fight. What is the point, he says, of warships and city walls and glittering statues if we are not happy? If we have lost sight of what is good?<br><br>His is a question that is more pertinent now than ever. He asks: &#x2018;What is the right way to live?&#x2019;<br><br><i>I am a stinging fly, sent to goad the city as though it were a huge, thoroughbred horse,<br>which because of its size is rather sluggish and needs to be stirred.</i><br><br>When Socrates comes into focus, in Greece in the fifth century bc, he is no didact: he wanders through the streets of Athens, debating the essence of what it means to be human. For the young men (and women) of the city he is irresistible: his relentless questioning appears to tap man&#x2019;s potential for self-knowledge. His &#x2018;ethics&#x2019; programme centres on the search for the &#x2018;good life&#x2019;. His, it was whispered &#x2013; then and through the next 2,400 years &#x2013; is a voice of incomparable <i>sophia</i>: of knowledge, skill, wisdom and truth.<br>The greater part of Socrates&#x2019; life was spent out in public, in Athens, philosophising unrestricted. But when the philosopher was seventy, Athens turned against him. In March 399 bc the ageing citizen was tried in a religious court and found guilty of both primary and secondary charges: &#x2018;<i>not duly acknowledging the city&#x2019;s gods and inventing new ones</i>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<i>corrupting the youth</i>&#x2019;. The death sentence was passed: four weeks or so later Socrates killed himself by drinking the hemlock poison left for him by his jailer in his Athenian cell.<br><br>Socrates&#x2019; arguments were perhaps just too incendiary, too dangerously charismatic. He believed that man had the potential to enjoy perfect happiness. A clue to the contemporary impact of his ideas is given by his pupil Plato. In the <i>Allegory of the Cave</i>, with cool detail, Plato has Socrates describe a race of men who have been born in chains, and who, staring for ever at a cave wall, see only the shadows of creatures above them and believe these shadows to be reality. He then reveals the dismay and joy these captives feel when they are brought, blinking, into the light of the real world. The chained men represent those of humanity who have yet to hear or understand what Socrates has to say.<br><br>However, when it comes to wholeheartedly embracing the new, mankind displays a poor record. In a superstitious city, Socrates&#x2019; spiritual and moral make-up was unconventional, troubling. He seems to have suffered from some form of epilepsy or &#x2018;petit mal&#x2019; (hence his curious cataleptic seizures, when he stared into the distance for hours on end), which in a pious age was interpreted as a malign &#x2018;inner voice&#x2019;. His contemporary the playwright Aristophanes talks of the passionate men who go to hear him preach and<br>turn their minds to fundamental issues rather than frivolities as having been &#x2018;Socratified&#x2019;. And in his comedy <i>Clouds</i>, Aristophanes jeers at Socrates&#x2019; high-minded eccentricities, has him clamber into a raised bath and scramble around in the clouds to &#x2018;peer at the arse of the moon&#x2019;. Democracies need pragmatists, yet Socrates refuses to contain himself, to temper the power of principle. So pheme &#x2013; rumour, gossip &#x2013; starts to fly through Athena&#x2019;s city. As the robust philosopher is only too aware, a whispering campaign is the most pernicious and insidious of enemies.<br><br>These people who have thrown scandal at me are genuinely dangerous. They&#x2019;ve used<br>envy and slander and they&#x2019;re difficult to deal with. I cannot possibly bring them into court<br>to cross-question them or refute their charges. I have to defend myself as if I were boxing<br>with shadows.<br><br><b>Socratic thought and the living Socrates</b><br><br><i>In all cities, it is easier to hurt a man than to help him.</i><br>Plato, Meno, 94e<br><br>In the Metropolitan Museum in New York hangs a painting of Socrates, just before death, by the great neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David. Socrates &#x2013; speaking slowly but determinedly, the hemlock about to run through his veins, a martyr to virtue and high principle &#x2013; is surrounded by agitated disciples. Crouched around his bed are those men such as Plato who will carry his words into literature and thus on into the very DNA of world civilisation.<br><br><i>Now it is time for us to go away, for me to die and for you to live; but which of us<br>is going to a better condition is not known to anyone except god.</i><br>This is not a book of philosophic theory. I am a historian, not a philosopher, and cannot possibly better the work of those who have gone before me, who have squeezed ever-evolving interpretations out of Socrates&#x2019; philosophical ideas; Plato, Aristotle, Diogenes the Cynic, Al-Kindi, Yehuda ha-Levi, Thomas Hobbes et al. &#x2013; all these men have tussled with what Socrates&#x2019; philosophy means. That is a bulging canon and one I would not presume to augment. But I can turn my eyes to the stones under my feet. I can see how Socrates&#x2019; philosophy evolved in his time and his place.<br><br>For the purposes of this book, the joy of Socratic thought is that Socrates did not believe in or deal with abstracts. For him, morality stemmed from and emerged to deal with real problems in a real world. The characters he employs as porters for his ideas are often cobblers, bakers, priestesses, whores. Socrates continually emphasises that he is flesh and blood, and that it is as a flesh and-blood man that he lived and understood life. It is one of the reasons his philosophy is so accessible to all of us. So bringing the humble, the archaeological and the physical back into the Socratic experience is appropriate. The totemic ideas that Socrates delivered were, put simply, as much to do with the religious ritual he had just witnessed down at his local harbour, with the pleasure of walking barefoot through Athens, with the death of a loved one, or the horror of living through a wasting-war, as they were with any kind of purely intellectual concept. Socrates&#x2019; prime concern was with the world as lived. As this book weaves together the mongrel evidence for his life, where material remains are as valued as literary and documentary sources, a picture emerges of a world that is, for the first time, self-consciously trying to build a &#x2018;civilisation&#x2019; that is based on a &#x2018;democracy&#x2019;.<br><br>Yet Socrates is not concerned just with our surroundings, but what is<i> within</i> us. &#x2018;<i>He who orders us to know ourselves is bidding us to become acquainted with our soul</i>.&#x2019; Socrates is soulful. The philosopher believes open conversation an essential balm for the psyche. His method gets inner thoughts out into the public sphere, not as a monologue, but as a dialogue. For him this was cathartic &#x2013; Plato uses the Greek word <i>katharsis</i>&#x2013; releasing &#x2018;bad things&#x2019; from the spirit. Socrates is the first man for whom we have an extant record who explores how we should all live in the world, as the world was working out how to live with itself.<br><br><i>Truth is in fact a purification [katharsis] . . . and self-restraint and justice and courage<br>and wisdom itself are a kind of purification.</i><br><br>Socrates&#x2019; philosophy is relevant to all of us, not least because it has been so tenacious. From Elizabeth I to Martin Luther King, from the Third Reich to twenty-first-century America, Socrates&#x2019; example has been used to try to understand what society is, and what it should be. Socratic words filled the halls of Italian Renaissance humanists. The Jewish philosopher Yehuda ha-Levi in the eleventh century ad cites Socrates in a dialogue with King Khazar concerning the nature of Judaism. John Locke and Thomas Hobbes scatter their treatises of political theory with Socratic quotations. Socrates was also a central influence in early Islam. Al-Kindi, the &#x2018;first&#x2019; self-professed Arab philosopher, certainly the first Muslim philosopher, wrote extensive (long-lost) treatises on Socrates in the ninth century ad.18 Socratic wisdoms were quoted in coloured stone, mortared into the very fabric of public buildings in Samarkand. The philosopher was nominated one of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom, his nickname &#x2018;The Source&#x2019;. Socrates&#x2019; inner voice was thought by medieval Muslims a sign that he was an angel in poor man&#x2019;s clothing. Throughout the Arab world from the eleventh century ad up until the present day he was said to refresh and nourish, &#x2018;like . . . the purest water in the midday heat&#x2019;.<br><br>And yet why should we still care for him? Why commemorate this longago life? One good reason is because Socrates does that shocking thing &#x2013; that thing we still crave &#x2013; he implies there might be a way to be fulfilled on this earth. Socrates was magnetic because h...</p><h2>Wild Berries &amp; Fruits Field Guide of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan (Wild Berries &amp; Fruits Identification Guides)</h2><p>Now you can identify wild berries and fruits.

Teresa Marrone has been gathering and preparing wild edibles for more than 20 years. Let her share that experience with you.</p><p><b>Teresa Marrone</b> is the author of more than a dozen outdoors-themed books, including the <i>Wild Berries &amp; Fruits Field Guide</i> series (currently available for four regions of the U.S.) and a new series of mushroom ID guides. She has also written numerous cookbooks about wild foods and has been gathering and preparing wild edibles for three decades. Teresa lives in Minneapolis with her husband, Bruce, and enjoys shooting photos of mushrooms, berries, other plants, and all things wild in the area surrounding their property abutting Minnesota&#x2019;s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.<p><b>Cranberries</b><br> <i>Vaccinium spp.</i></p> <p><b>HABITAT:</b> Three species of wild cranberry are native to our region: small cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccus</i>), large cranberry (<i>V. macrocarpon</i>) and northern mountain cranberry (<i>V. vitis-idaea var. minus</i>). All are found in wet, acidic areas such as sphagnum bogs, swampy spots and fens.</p> <p><b>GROWTH:</b> A ground-hugging trailing plant; technically a subshrub, but vine-like in growth habit. Stems are slender and hairless. Cranberry plants often take root at the leaf nodes, forming dense mats.</p> <p><b>LEAVES:</b> Smooth, hairless, leathery evergreen leaves grow alternately on the slender stems. Leaves of small cranberry are less than 3&#x2044;8 inch long, lance-shaped with pointed tips, and white underneath; edges are rolled. Leaves of large cranberry are 1&#x2044;4 to 5&#x2044;8 inch long, narrowly oval with blunt tips, and pale underneath, but not as white as those of small cranberry; edges are flat or very slightly rolled. Leaves of northern mountain cranberry are 1&#x2044;4 to 3&#x2044;4 inch long, egg-shaped with rounded tips; undersides have tiny black resin dots (visible with a lens).</p> <p><b>FRUIT:</b> A tart, but delicious, red berry. Fruits of northern mountain cranberry and small cranberry grow on stalks at the tip of the stem; those of large cranberry grow along the stem rather than at the tip. Large cranberry has the largest fruits, averaging 1&#x2044;2 inch across; those of the other two species are 3&#x2044;8 inch or less. The fruits of large cranberry look out of proportion to the tiny leaves. There are no toxic look-alikes. </p><p><b>SEASON:</b> Cranberries ripen in late summer to early fall, and may persist on the evergreen plants through winter if not eaten by birds.</p> <p><b>COMPARE:</b> Several plants with edible berries have similar appearance. Creeping snowberry (pg. 258) has white berries; stems and leaves are hairy. Creeping wintergreen (pg. 110) has larger leaves, up to 2 inches. Both creeping snowberry and wintergreen smell spicy when crushed. Bearberry (pg. 108) has larger leaves, up to 1 inch, which are pointed at the base and broadly rounded at the tip.</p> <p><b>NOTES:</b> Cranberries are best when cooked, but can be eaten raw.</p></p><h2>Botticelli (Getting to Know the World&#39;s Greatest Artists)</h2><p>Examines the life and work of the Italian painter of the early Renaissance, describing and giving examples of his art.</p><p>Mike Venezia is the author of several nonfiction books for children.Grade 2-6-- Venezia believes that "the best way to introduce kids to art and artists is through fun , " but this admirable concept doesn't succeed. Goya begins with a self-portrait of the artist at 65, and continues with oversimplified biographical data and excellent reproductions of a variety of his paintings. The works range from a baroque ceiling fresco to The Madhouse at Zaragoza to The Third of May, which depicts a military execution. Botticelli contrasts markedly in style and subject, if only because the artist's work is much more accessible to young students than Goya's. Again the reproductions are superb, and the text extremely basic, but because classic Renaissance works are more obvious, oversimplification is less of a problem. In both titles, the cartoons inserted distract and detract from the effect of the art, and from the purpose of the books; readers unfamiliar with Goya and Botticelli won't have enough information from the text to understand the intended humor. Teachers may want these as sources of the reproductions in classrooms, but their research usefulness and browsing interest are marginal. --Dorcas Hand, Annunciation Orthodox School, Houston<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Martha Stewart&#39;s Hors d&#39;Oeuvres Handbook</h2><p>No one knows better how to give a party than Martha Stewart--and as she proves in this comprehensive and visually dazzling handbook, great parties begin with great hors d'oeuvres.

A Christmas story.</p><p></p><h2>Lincoln&#39;s Assassins: Their Trial and Execution</h2><p><p>Acclaimed as the definitive illustrated history of Abraham Lincoln's assassination, <em>Lincoln's Assassins</em>, by James L. Swanson and Daniel R. Weinberg, follows the shocking events from the tragic scene at Ford's Theatre to the trial and execution of Booth's co-conspirators. For twelve days after the president was shot, the nation waited breathlessly as manhunters tracked down John Wilkes Booth&#x2014;the story that was brilliantly told in Swanson's <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <em>Manhunt</em>. Then, during the spring and summer of 1865, a military commission tried eight people as conspirators in Booth's plot to murder Lincoln and other high officials, including the secretary of state and vice president. Few remember them today, but once the names Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, George Atzerodt, Edman Spangler, Samuel Arnold, Michael O'Laughlin, and Dr. Samuel Mudd were the most reviled and notorious in America.</p><p>In <em>Lincoln's Assassins</em>, Swanson and Weinberg resurrect these events by presenting an unprecedented visual record of almost 300 contemporary photographs, letters, documents, prints, woodcuts, newspapers, pamphlets, books, and artifacts, many hitherto unpublished. These rare materials, which took the authors decades to collect, evoke the popular culture of the time, record the origins of the Lincoln myth, take the reader into the courtroom and the cells of the accused, document the beginning of American photojournalism, and memorialize the fates of the eight conspirators.</p><p><em>Lincoln's Assassins</em> is a unique work that will appeal to anyone interested in American history, Abraham Lincoln, the Civil War, law, crime, assassination, nineteenth-century photographic portraiture, and the history of American photojournalism.</p></p><p><p>James Swanson is the Edgar Award-winning author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Manhunt</em> and its sequel, <em>Bloody Crimes</em>.</p><br><br><p>Daniel R. Weinberg has been the owner since 1971 of the Abraham Lincoln Book Shop in Chicago, which for the past sixty years has bought, sold, authenticated, and appraised original autographs, books, photographs, artwork, and ephemera related to Abraham Lincoln, the Civil War, and American history. Besides being an advisor to the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, Weinberg is a director of the Lincoln Forum, the Abraham Lincoln Association, and the Manuscript Society. He is on the executive board of the Professional Autograph Dealers Association and is a past president of the Civil War Round Table. He has helped build some of the major collections in the United States and gives lectures to numerous historical groups.</p>This beautifully produced, groundbreaking volume of over 300 documents, portraits, memorabilia and arcana relating to Lincoln's assassination manages to transcend its immediate historical importance to become something artistically unique. Swanson and Weinberg, both Lincoln collectors and scholars, have assembled a remarkable collection of images relating to the assassination and the fate of its perpetrators (whose guilt some historians question today), including many that have not been easily available before. Some of the more common images include memorial posters of the assassination, wanted posters, newspaper reports and reproductions of plates from books about the event. They also reproduce letters from a young John Wilkes Booth as well as hand-written death warrants issued by the Union army. But the centerpiece of the volume is the collection of photographs taken by Alexander Gardner of six of the indicted conspirators as they awaited trial. These photographs formally posed, beautifully shot and eerily evocative are reminiscent of the work of artists such as Diane Arbus and Robert Mapplethorpe. Equally moving and disturbing are Gardner's photographs of the executions by hanging of several of the conspirators photos in which one can see the reality of death. Swanson and Weinberg contribute enough text to place all of these artifacts in historical context and provide an intelligent, informative primer on the topic. (Nov.)Forecast: While the idea of a coffee-table or art book on such a topic might seem grisly, this volume achieves high marks in both categories and will be read and examined by both academics and Civil War enthusiasts.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Chilton&#39;s Ford Full Size Trucks 1987-93 Repair Manual (Chilton&#39;s Total Car Care)</h2><p>Book by Freeman, Kerry A.</p><p></p><h2>Wolf Captured</h2><p>Raised by sentient, language-using wolves, then later plunged back into human society, young Firekeeper has found that her training as a pack animal stands her in good stead amidst deadly political intrigues.<br><br>When Firekeeper and her Royal Wolf companion Blind Seer are kidnapped and dragged overseas, they must maneuver for their lives in an unfamiliar new society.

Always wanted to try hand dyeing your own fabric but found it too intimidating? Now you can put those worries aside and create beautiful colors to fit your every whim. And the best part is there are no confusing, complicated formulas to follow.</p><p>Laurel Anderson comes from a long line of fiber artists. She began quilting when her sons entered school and has never looked back. Today her quilting stash fills half a garage! She lives in Carmichael, California. Visit Laurel on the Web at: www.whispercolor.comIf you've ever seen the colourful work of Freida Anderson, you will know that she hand-dyes all of her fabrics. This 80 page book published by C&amp;T Publishing is squarely aimed at the first time dyer. About a third of the book is devoted to the basics of dyeing including: sourcing supplies and equipment; setting up your dyeing workspace; preparing your dyes and fabric; dyeing 12-step colour wheel gradations in dark, medium and light values; dyeing 6-step gradations in complementary colours and colour family sets; flat dyeing and using resists; washing and drying your fabrics. This is followed by a six page quilt gallery; a ten page section of fusing and finishing basics (fused binding, pillow-case finish, pleated sleeves and labels) and five fused projects with increasing complexity (Jack in the Pulpit, Irises, a dog portrait, Autumnal Trees, and Amish Leaves.) There are lots of bright photos to get you in the mood (who can resist the lolly-like appeal of colour gradations?!) Frieda uses a method of pre-soaking fabrics in soda-ash solution and then applying dye solutions made from simple formulae using cup, tablespoon and teaspoon measurements. It's not rocket science, it's not hard and it's not novel but that's the point. For someone who is new to the wonder of dyeing, the book presents clear step-by-step instructions to get started. I wish Frieda's book Fabric to Dye For had been available when I first started dyeing fabrics. (Serendipity, March 26, 2010)<br><br>Frieda's instructions for dyeing fabric in 72 colors using only seven Procion dye colors, three bright, three warm and a basic black, are exceptionally well organized, concise and easy to follow. She includes a list of all of the necessary tools and materials, safety precautions and advice on different kinds of dyeing using containers, flat surfaces resists, pour dyeing and painting with thickened dye. A section on making fused art quilts with your newly created hand dyed fabrics is also included, and Frieda tells you how to design, fuse, machine quilt and finish your piece. Five delightful fused quilt patterns and instructions are given, as well as a gallery of artwork by the author and other artists for your inspiration. (Machine Quilting Unlimited, May 1, 2010)<br><br>Beginner fabric dyers will delight in Frieda Anderson's user-friendly guide to coloring your own cloth. If you're new to dyeing, or simply want to perfect your practice, you'll find all the necessary information within these pages. Anderson focuses on Procion MX dyes and comprehensibly takes the reader through all steps of the fabric dyeing process, from preparing the fixative to mixing the dyes and immersing the fabrics. She focuses on gradation dyeing in particular, demonstrating how just a few colors can be used to create a collection of fabrics in a range of harmonized hues. Techniques for dyeing fabric flat and dye painting are also included. Anderson even outlines the basics of fusing and finishing your quilts, and includes five fusing projects that allow you to put your newly dyed fabrics to use. For a first-time dyer, this basic and straightforward guide has all you need to get started. (Quilting Arts, April 1, 2010)<br><br>Have you ever wanted to dye your own fabrics but were concerned about the messy, complex process? Then this book is for you. Frieda shows you how to dye fabrics at home with inexpensive equipment and supplies. The step-by-step instructions and easy-to- follow charts are a must for first-time dyers. Frieda even offers helpful wardrobe tips - dressing for dyeing as well as patterns for five quilting projects in her signature style. (Quilters Newsletter, June 1, 2010)<br><br>Frieda Anderson has been dyeing fabrics to use in her quiltmaking for many years. Fabric to Dye For is an accumulation of her knowledge so that the rest of us don't have to learn the hard way. Written with the first-time dyer in mind, she has focused on a process that is easy (using Procioen MX powdered dyes) and requires only basic, inexpensive equipment that can be purchased at a hardware store or supermarket. The technique section of the book is detailed and illustrated with lots of useful photographs. A gallery of Frieda's quilts made from her hand-dyed fabrics and instructions for using your own hand-dyed fabrics in five small quilt projects are also included.

What followed was an unprecedented avalanche of press coverage, the original &#x201c;trial of the century,&#x201d; and a wave of censorship that altered the course of Hollywood filmmaking. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It began on Labor Day, when comic actor Roscoe &#x201c;Fatty&#x201d; Arbuckle, then at the pinnacle of his fame and fortune, hosted a party in San Francisco&#x2019;s best hotel. As the party raged, he was alone in room 1219 with Virginia Rappe, a minor actress. Four days later, she died, and he was charged with her murder. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Room 1219<b> </b></i>tells the story of Arbuckle&#x2019;s improbable rise and stunning fall&#x2014;from Hollywood&#x2019;s first true superstar to its first pariah. Simultaneously, it presents the crime story from the day of the &#x201c;orgy&#x201d; through the three trials. Relying on a careful examination of documents, the book finally reveals, after almost a century of wild speculation, what most likely occurred in room 1219. In addition, <i>Room 1219<b> </b></i>covers the creation of the film industry&#x2014;from the first silent experiments to a studio-based system capable of making and, ultimately, breaking a beloved superstar.</p></p><p><p><b>Greg Merritt</b> is the author of <i>Film Production: The Complete Uncensored Guide to Independent Filmmaking</i> and <i>Celluloid Mavericks: A History of American Independent Film</i>.

Gold has been discovered in the Yukon. New York is under the sway of Hearst and Pulitzer. And in a few months, an American battleship will explode in a Cuban harbor, plunging the U.S. into war. Spanning five years and half a dozen countries, this is the unforgettable story of that extraordinary moment: the turn of the twentieth century, as seen by one of the greatest storytellers of our time.<br><br>Shot through with a lyrical intensity and stunning detail that recall Doctorow and <i>Deadwood</i> both, <i>A Moment in the Sun</i> takes the whole era in its sights from the white-racist coup in Wilmington, North Carolina to the bloody dawn of U.S. interventionism in the Philippines. Beginning with Hod Brackenridge searching for his fortune in the North, and hurtling forward on the voices of a breathtaking range of men and women Royal Scott, an African American infantryman whose life outside the military has been destroyed; Diosdado Concepc�on, a Filipino insurgent fighting against his country&#x2019;s new colonizers; and more than a dozen others, Mark Twain and President McKinley&#x2019;s assassin among them this is a story as big as its subject: history rediscovered through the lives of the people who made it happen.<br></p><p>John Sayles&#x2019;s previous novels include <i>Pride of the Bimbos</i>, <i>Los Gusanos</i>, and the National Book Award nominated <i>Union Dues</i>. He has directed seventeen feature films, including <i>Matewan</i>, <i>Lone Star</i>, and <i>Eight Men Out</i>, and received two Academy Award nominations. His latest film, <i>Amigo</i>, was completed in 2010.A <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> TOP 100 NOTABLE BOOK OF 2011<br><br>"[<i>A Moment in the Sun</i>'s] true importance lies not in its rearview relevance but in its commitment to recalling in heroic detail a little-known and contradictory historical moment, a sunny time of American pride but also of hubris in sun-beaten locales Sayles is not a neutral channel, but in his respect for facts both documented and extrapolated, he is devoted to offering us a new understanding of the past."<br> Tom LeClair, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"A brutal picaresque complete with melancholy whores, militaristic robber barons, desperate cutthroat prospectors, and puppet soldiers... His period slang rings dead-on perfect. [Sayles's] great achievement is to illuminate the parallel between imperialism and racism in turn-of-the-century America indeed, to shine so glaring a light on it that even if we screw our eyes shut, the horror remains."<br> William T. Vollmann, <i>Bookforum</i><br><br> Independent filmmaker John Sayles has managed to create a work that is both cinematic and literary in its scope and style a blend so entrancing that you could polish off its 955 pages in one long weekend. It begins in 1897 during the Yukon gold rush and takes us into the Spanish-American war, the Filipino fight for independence, racial injustice and the plight of working people throughout the United States. Short, powerful chapters follow four unconnected characters to create a mosaic of America as a nascent superpower, underscoring the personal and cultural consequences of its ambitions. If you only read one book this summer, make it A Moment in the Sun.&#x201d;<br> Lucia Silva, NPR&#x2019;s <i>Morning Edition</i><br><br> Following four major characters and dozens of sharply drawn smaller ones, Moment jumps from a horse thief&#x2019;s prison break to a Filipino revolutionary secretly photographing a government execution, creating a story so big that even the larger-than-life characters that Sayles weaves into his narrative are dwarfed by comparison. Pick up McSweeney&#x2019;s gorgeous mock-leather-and-gilt tome taking care to lift with your knees and you&#x2019;ll find that the 950-page book moves far more quickly than its bulk might suggest.&#x201d;<br> Sam Adams, <i>The Onion A.V. Club</i><br><br> John Sayles may be better known as a filmmaker (<i>Lone Star</i>, <i>Eight Men Out</i>, and my favorite, <i>Return of the Secaucus 7</i>) than as a novelist, but this drama spanning five years, and stretching from Cuba to the Philippines, proves him to be a great fiction writer. The conscience that infuses his earlier work is evident in this novel, and if you're looking for a summer reading challenge with a big payoff, this may be your book. Sayles tells a story of American racism and American imperialism at the turn of the century, through a kaleidoscope of imaginary and real-life characters, including Joseph Pulitzer, William Randolph Hearst and Mark Twain.&#x201d;<br> Elizabeth Taylor, <i>Chicago Tribune</i> (Editor&#x2019;s Choice)<br><br> Sayles is a terrific writer. His breathtaking precision and attention to detail can make E.L. Doctorow's historical novels look puny and slapdash by comparison. His ability to map the intersections of scores of plots and hundreds of fictional and real-life characters is truly stunning.&#x201d;<br> Adam Langer, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br> <i>A Moment in the Sun</i>'s moment is now, a strapping 935 pages, a sprawling <i>U.S.A.</i>-style novel that, something like the John Dos Passos classic, follows a group of characters in parallel tracks as they traverse the America of 1897, taking in the Yukon gold rush, the Spanish-American War in the Philippines, and the advent of movies. Like all Sayles films and novels, it's drenched in a detailed, loving awareness of time and place.&#x201d;<br> <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br><br> Absolutely vivid... Sayles&#x2019;s creative strengths are on full display.&#x201d;<br> <i>Newsweek/The Daily Beast</i><br><br>"In his most spectacular work of fiction to date, filmmaker Sayles combines wonder and outrage in a vigorous dramatization of overlooked and downright shameful aspects of turn-of-the-nineteenth-century America. Crackling with rare historical details, spiked with caustic humor, and fueled by incandescent wrath over racism, sexism, and serial injustice against working people, Sayles&#x2019; hard-driving yet penetrating and compassionate saga explicates the 'fever dream' of commerce, the crimes of war, and the dream of redemption."<br> Donna Seaman, <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br><br>"Though known best as a filmmaker (<i>Eight Men Out</i>), Sayles is also an accomplished novelist (<i>Union Dues</i>), whose latest will stand among the finest work on his impressive r�sum�. Weighing in at nearly 1,000 pages, the behemoth recalls E.L. Doctorow's <i>Ragtime</i>, Pynchon's <i>Against the Day</i>, and Dos Passos's <i>USA</i> trilogy, tracking mostly unconnected characters whose collective stories create a vast, kaleidoscopic panorama of the turn of the last century."<br> <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br><br>"Sayles&#x2019;s cat-squasher of a book... pulls all his characters onto a huge global stage, setting them into motion as America goes to war against Spain and takes its first giant step toward becoming a world power. The narrative is full of historical lessons of the Howard Zinn/Studs Terkel radical-revisionist school, but Sayles is too good a writer to be a propagandist; his stories tell their own lessons and many will be surprises...

The inherent magical power of herbs comes directly from the source of all creation, and it has the potential to transform our lives. For Wiccans, herbal magic keeps us literally in touch with the energies of the Earth, along with the Sun, the rain, the wind, and every living thing that sustains the cycle of life and death in all of its forms. When used wisely, herbs can help us create what we desire, in matters of love, health, wealth, and more.<br><br>Of course, working with herbs is a tradition much older than any known form of Wicca or other Witchcraft. Since the beginning of human history, healers, shamans, and other medicine people have understood the nutritional, medicinal, and magical properties of herbs. Now, <i>Lisa Chamberlain</i> brings this knowledge to modern Wiccans, Witches, and others who are interested in practicing this diverse form of natural magic. Whether you&#x2019;re well-practiced in other forms of magic but are just discovering herbs, or new to magic altogether, <i>Herbal Magic</i> provides an excellent place to begin your magical journey.<br><br>Many books on magical herbs contain extensive lists of ingredients that may be expensive, difficult to find, or both. Unless you already have a well-stocked herb pantry, trying to decide where to start can be overwhelming. In addition, some books provide spells that call for just a pinch of a rare herb you have to order online, which can be rather inefficient&#x2014;especially if the herb only appears in one spell! The spells in <em>Herbal Magic</em> are all centered around the same 13 herbs, most of which are inexpensive and easy to find. Most are also culinary and/or medicinal herbs, so you&#x2019;ll have plenty of options for using anything leftover from your spellwork. This approach to the subject makes it easier and far more efficient for you to get your herbal practice underway!<br><br><p><b><b>Foundations of Herbal Magic</b></b></p><br><br>Of course, not all herbs have the same magical properties. Some herbs, like lavender and cinnamon, are primarily used for matters of the heart. Others, including basil and sage, are called upon for protection spells. Then there&#x2019;s the variety of uses for herbs&#x2014;teas, sachets, baths, oils and charms, to name a few&#x2014;that makes this form of magic more versatile than any other. In <em>Herbal Magic</em>, you&#x2019;ll find plenty of useful information and inspiring ideas, including:<br><br><ul> <li><b>A brief history of our relationship with the magic of the plant kingdom, dating back to the earliest civilizations</b></li> <li>Core concepts underlying the &#x201c;why&#x201d; and &#x201c;how&#x201d; of herbal magic</li> <li><b>Profiles of 13 of the most popular and readily available herbs used by Witches today, including their magical properties and associations</b></li> <li>Essential practical tips for working with herbs, including buying, growing, foraging, storing and charging for magical use</li> <li><b>An herbal grimoire featuring several spells and recipes for magical teas, oils, bath blends and other magical creations</b></li> <li>Tables of correspondence with magical properties of commonly used herbs, essential oils and incense</li></ul>By the end of this guide, you&#x2019;ll have a solid foundation from which to build your own practice of working with magical herbs.

After all, he never knew he had a "second cousin, twice removed" in America, much less that his eccentric relative had recently committed suicide by jumping out of the third floor bedroom window&#x2014;at the same age and in the same way as his father had before him . . .<br> <br> Together with A.&#x2019;s companion, Niamh, a mute teenage punk girl from Ireland, they arrive in Virginia and quickly come to feel as if they have inherited much more than just a rambling home and an opulent lifestyle. Axton House is haunted... they know it...but the presence of a ghost is just the first of a series of disturbing secrets they slowly uncover. What led to the suicides? What became of the Axton House butler who fled shortly after his master died? What lurks in the garden maze &#x2013; and what does the basement vault keep? Even more troubling, what of the rumors in town about a mysterious yearly gathering at Axton House on the night of the winter solstice?<br> <br> Told vividly through a series of journal entries, cryptic ciphers, recovered security footage, and letters to a distant Aunt Liza, Edgar Cantero has written an absorbing, kinetic and highly original supernatural adventure with classic horror elements that introduces readers to a deviously sly and powerful new voice.</p><p>EDGAR CANTERO is a writer and cartoonist from Barcelona working in Catalan, Spanish and English.

These are the flies of legend (62 of them) - nationally acclaimed patterns, such as the Emergent Sparkle Pupa, and completely new innovations, such as the Twist Nymph, the hot stillwater imitation - but this isn't another recipe book. It drips with fine observations on the habitat, the fish, and the techniques. This work is a top-to-bottom analysis of day-to-day situations in all types of trout water. It gives anglers the best of modern flies - and all the information they need to fool fish consistently with these exciting patterns. (8 1/2 x 10 3/4, 280 pages, color photos, b&amp;w photos, illustrations)</p><p>LaFontaine's landmark book <i>Caddisflies</i> set the standard for taking a scientific approach to the sport of catching trout on a fly. In <i>Trout Flies: Proven Patterns</i>, he combines observation with a deep understanding of entomology to examine the art of fly tying. This large, attractive volume boasts color plates, step-by-step diagrams, and the author's lively discussion of patterns that work--and why they succeed. Twenty years of research and development are reflected in these pages, with many proven variations on dries, emergers, nymphs, wets, and streamers.

In this outspoken, brash, self-serving autobiography, Cohn defends McCarthy's anti-Communist campaign, and his own role in it, by arguing that the senator's anti-subversive tactics merely carried out mainstream Democratic policies of the Truman era. Cohn offers seamy revelations concerning his secret conversations with the judge in the Rosenberg espionage trial and how he got a United States Attorney his job with an assist from a Mafia boss. He makes wicked, wisecracking comments about Bush, Mayor Koch, Ford and Mondale, and bitterly settles accounts with Robert Morgenthau and Robert Kennedy. Zion, former correspondent for the New York Times, worked with Cohn on this tell-all, adding some chapters after Cohn's recent death from AIDS. He provides an ironic glimpse of Cohn sporting in the gay underworld while he publicly bashed homosexual rights. Photos. 50,000 first printing. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.From a 20-year acquaintanceship and a series of interviews shortly before Cohn's death in 1986, New York journalist Zion has fashioned a boffo "autobiography." Although the final portions are Zion on Cohn, most of the book is told in Cohn's own voice. From his youth in the Bronx, his prosecution of the Rosenbergs, his role in the McCarthy-Army hearings, his multiple indictments in the 1960s, to his later years as legal gunslinger extraordinaire, Cohn tells all in his characteristic slam-bang style. Zion, while clearly in awe of Cohn's power, pulls no punches in discussing his subject's gay lifestyle and death from AIDSboth of which Cohn denied to the end. Fascinating.

Perhaps no man alive knows the lifestyle of wiseguys better than Pistone does, having spent six years infiltrating the Mafia as an undercover FBI agent. Now, years later, Pistone reassesses the underworld. Often poignant, and in startling detail, THE WAY OF THE WISEGUY gives readers a first-hand look at the psychology and customs of the wiseguy.The book features 34 chapters that reveal key principles of wiseguy life, including How Wiseguys Carry Out a Hit,&#x201d; How Wiseguys Get Straightened Out,&#x201d; and A Typical Day in the Life of a Wiseguy.&#x201d; Pistone's spellbinding stories provide a first-hand look at this lawless realm of badguys, which is often uncannily relevant to the workings of legitimate big business and everyday social discourse.</p><p>Joseph D. Pistone is the legendary FBI Special Agent who put his life on the line to infiltrate the U.S. Mafia for six years, resulting in the convictions of over 200 mobsters. He lives in an undisclosed location.The romanticized view of the mob gets a reality check in this fascinating guide to the real Cosa Nostra from Pistone, who successfully infiltrated one of New York City's five families as an FBI undercover agent in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During his six years posing as Donnie Brasco, Pistone managed to gain the trust of countless mobsters and was almost formally made a member of the Mafia. That access led to numerous investigations and prosecutions resulting in more than 100 convictions, including those of the bosses who formed the mob's ruling body, the Commission. Pistone's first book, the bestselling <i>Donnie Brasco</i> (later filmed with Johnny Depp in the lead role), presented a detailed chronological narrative of his infiltration. This time, he has organized his experiences into short chapters describing what the gangsters he worked with were really like, with titles such as "A Typical Day in the Life of a Wiseguy" and "How Wiseguys Take over a Business." He makes abundantly clear that the codes of honor depicted in popular culture and self-serving Mafiosi memoirs are myths, as is the notion that the old-timers steered clear of drug-dealing for moral reasons. The book also contains an amazing extra-a CD of an actual FBI surveillance tape in which thugs talk about the idea of doing in Donnie Brasco. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Robert Wohl`s fascinating story describes Wilbur Wright and other colorful early aeronauts, aces such as Baron von Richthofen, and the enthusiastic responses to the implications of aviation by such writers and artists as H. G. Wells, Franz Kafka, Kazimir Malevich, Robert Delaunay, Gabriele D`Annunzio, and Emile Driant.</p><p>Robert Wohl is Distinguished Professor of History, University of California at Los Angeles.Wohl, a history professor at UCLA, has written the first cultural history of early aviation, bringing into sharp focus its impact on Western culture during the decade 1908-18. Illustrated with 300 rare photos, paintings, drawings and posters, including more than 100 in color, this large-format book reveals the powerful effect of aviation imagery on the popular imagination, the mythologizing of the "flying aces" of the Great War and the far-reaching implications for the new century's artistic and moral sensibility. Examples show how the invention of the flying machine inspired a generation of artists and writers including H.G. Wells, Franz Kafka, Gabriele D'Annunzio, Edmond Rostand, Kazimir Malevich, Robert Delaunay and many others. Wohl (The Generation of 1914) emphasizes the centrality of France in pre-1918 aviation; the first aviation competition, flight training school and major manufacturing plant for planes were located there.

In the spring of 1944, Japanese 15th Army was shattered at Imphal and Kohima, allowing General William Slim, commander of 14th Army, to liberate Burma overland from India &#x2013; a task considered impossible by the British chiefs of staff. Overcoming immense logistical problems, Slim coordinated a precisely timed attack along a 200-mile front, the longest opposed river crossing of the entire war, and an armored dash behind enemy lines that seized Meiktila, cutting Japanese supply lines. Mandalay fell and at the end of March 1945, with the battle lost, the Japanese withdrew south. Slim gave them no chance; Allied troops raced south and captured Rangoon.

Each region has its own particular spirits, from the Celtic ghosts of Cornwall to the dobies and boggarts of the north. Some speak and some are silent, some smell of old leather, others of fragrant thyme. From medieval times to today stories have been told and apparitions seen -- ghosts who avenge injustice, souls who long for peace, spooks who just want to have fun.<br><br><b>The English Ghost</b> is a treasury of such sightings which we can believe or not, as we will. The accounts, packed with eerie detail, range from the door-slamming, shrieking ghost of Hinton Manor in the 1760s and the moaning child that terrified Wordsworth's nephew at Cambridge, to the headless bear of Kidderminster, the violent daemon of Devon who tried to strangle a man with his cravat and the modern-day hitchhikers on Bluebell Hill. Comical and scary, like all good ghost stories, these curious incidents also plumb the depths of the English psyche in its yearnings for justice, freedom and love.</p><p>PETER ACKROYD is internationally known as a novelist and cultural historian. His non-fiction books include<i> </i><b>Albion: The Origin of the English Imagination</b>, the prize-winning <b>London: a Biography</b>, and most recently <b>Venice: City of Life.</b>"Ackroyd's book has its fair share of terrified hauntees and, unless you're a sceptic, there are plenty of scenes that will make the hairs on the back of your neck bristle." <br><i>&#x2014; Mail on Sunday<br><br></i>"Ackroyd's collection glides seamlessly from terror to humour to downright peculiarity: it is the ideal read as the nights darken and Halloween approaches." <br><i>&#x2014;&nbsp;Metro<br></i><br>"This is a wonderful little book. It's properly old-fashioned and unorthodox, a scrapbook of clues, tittle-tattle, hints and mortal byways." <br><i>&#x2014;&nbsp;Independent</i><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Battle: A History Of Combat And Culture</h2><p><i>Battle: A History of Combat and Culture</i> spans the globe and the centuries to explore the way ideas shape the conduct of warfare. Drawing its examples from Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, and America, John A. Lynn challenges the belief that technology has been the dominant influence on combat from ancient times to the present day. In battle, ideas can be more far more important than bullets or bombs. Carl von Clausewitz proclaimed that war is politics, but even more basically, war is culture. The hard reality of armed conflict is formed by - and, in turn, forms - a culture's values, assumptions, and expectations about fighting. The author examines the relationship between the real and the ideal, arguing that feedback between the two follows certain discernable paths. Battle rejects the currently fashionable notion of a "Western way of warfare" and replaces it with more nuanced concepts of varied and evolving cultural patterns of combat. After considering history, Lynn finally asks how the knowledge gained might illuminate our understanding of the war on terrorism.</p><p><b>John A. Lynn</b>, an expert on seventeenth- and eighteenth-century warfare professor, is a professor of history at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an adjunct professor at Ohio State University. He lives in Champaign, Illinois.Without denying the existence of such constants as fear and courage, Lynn, a historian at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, seeks in this volume to refute "universal" models of interpreting warfare. Classical Greece, he argues, sought decisive battle because of its particular values emphasizing individual worth and independence, while in ancient India and China, the dominant values emphasized deception and diplomacy. Medieval Europe balanced a brutal reality of highly destructive mutual raiding with an artificial form of war in the tournament and an idealized form in the crusade. The European wars of the 18th century were defined by style and aesthetics, manifestations of the conscious mixture of fashion and function that reflected general European taste. Similarly, 19th-century Europe's concept of the decisive battle, argues Lynn (The Wars of Louis XIV), was influenced more by a Romantic high culture than by specifically military factors such as weapons systems or mass armies. Even the U.S.-Japanese conflict from 1941 to 1945, Lynn contends, was shaped by a profound contrast in military cultures, one emphasizing survival and the other self-immolation. The final chapter discusses the Egyptian army's conscious and rejection in 1973 of maneuver warfare in favor of a set-piece approach more congruent with its supporting cultures. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Reading the Past: Ancient Writing From Cuneiform to the Alphabet</h2><p>Hardcover reprint of the 1990 British Museum volume.

She died in 1957.In UNNATURAL DEATH, one of the early books in the Lord Peter Whimsey mystery series, Lord Peter investigates what he fears may be the perfect murder. The narrator, Ian Carmichael, gives a superb performance in general, but it takes a few minutes in the beginning to adjust to his accent and fast pace. It's also a puzzle that Carmichael does not differentiate between two main characters, Lord Peter Whimsey and his friend, Inspector Parker from Scotland Yard, when he is quite capable of doing so as he demonstrates with "lower-class" and minor characters of the story, whom he renders in a lively and satisfying manner.

In this third account of their adventures, the castaways are again shipwrecked and separated. Ben is captured by the slave trader Al Misurata, while Ned is rescued by a company of itinerant entertainers. The two are reunited when the entertainers, the Rizzoli Troupe, are forced to perform for the trader, and all of them end up on Al Misurata's ship to be sold as slaves. Ned speaks to Ben telepathically, and since no one would expect a dog to understand human language, he overhears the villain's plans. This is just the beginning of the swashbuckling adventure as Ben and his black Labrador attempt to escape the ship and to rescue the Rizzoli Troupe, while, at the same time, avoiding recapture by the ghostly sailors of the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>. Numerous footnotes translate various snatches of dialogue in German or Italian. This can be either helpful or annoying, depending on your way of looking at it. However, it is easy to just enjoy the compelling and readable adventure.

At the end of the twentieth Century a new expression of Christian Spirituality is forming which is focused on biblical truth but is less concerned with denominational labels. Drawing its support from both Catholics and Protestants, writers such as Richard Foster and Henri Nouwen have been the most popular. Now comes a major new addition: Dallas Willard. The Divine Conspiracy is a moving and penetrating exploration of human existance and human nature. It considers in a fresh way the abiding truths of judgement and grace and what he memorably calls &#39;theologies of sin management&#39;. All this is set against a backdrop of modern materialism. &#39;His stories charm. His examples teach,&#39; says Richard Foster, here is &#39;a soul satisfying banquet,&#39; which he places alongside the writings of John Wesley, Martin Luther, Teresa of Avila &#39;and perhaps even Thomas Aquinas and Augustine of Hippo.&#39; This is a book for the next millennium.</p><p>Dallas Willard, an acclaimed theologian and professor of philosophy at the University of Southern California, fulfills the longing of many Christians who want to live as true disciples of Christ rather than distant dabblers. Likewise, he scoffs at consumer Christians who are simply banking on admittance to heaven as their payoff for attending church. Or worse still, those who use Christianity to advance their political agendas rather than their spiritual ones. But this is not a scolding book. Rather, Willard devotes his efforts to discussing specific and inspiring ways to develop a discipleship to Jesus--not as an act of sacrifice or even one of spiritual luxury--instead, as everyday people committed to the teachings of Christ. "The really good news for Christians is that Jesus is now taking students in the master class of life," writes Willard. "So the message of and about him is specifically a gospel for our life now, not just for dying. It is about living now as his apprentices in kingdom living, not just as consumers of his merits." <i>--Gail Hudson</i>"I am struck by many things in <i>The Divine Conspiracy...</i> <p>First, I am struck by the comprehensive nature of this book...It provides me with a conceptual philosophy for understanding the meaning and purpose of human existence...The breadth of the issues covered is astonishing: from the soul's redemption and justification to discipleship and our growth in grace to death and the state of our existence in heaven... </p><p>Second, I am struck by the accessibility of this book. I'm fully aware that the issues discussed here are of immense importance, yet it is all so understandable, so readable, so applicable... </p><p>Third, I am struck by the depth of this book. Willard is a master at capturing the central insight of Jesus' teachings. Perhaps this is because he takes Jesus seriously as an intelligent, fully competent Teacher. He writes, 'Jesus is not just bright, he is brilliant.'... </p><p>My fourth and final observation...I am struck by the warmth of this book. Rarely have I found an author with so penetrating an intellect combined with so generous a spirit. Clearly he has descended with the mind into the heart and from this place he touches us, both mind and heart."--From the foreword by Richard J.

These spectacular carnivorous plants produce leaves lined with tiny tentacles tipped with droplets of glistening, sticky mucus. Small insects become affixed to the sticky, fly-paper leaves of Pinguicula, die and are digested offering the plant nutrients to grow. In Pinguicula of the Temperate North, all Pinguicula taxa from the USA, Canada, Europe, Asia and northern Africa are documented in lavish detail. The morphology, diversity, taxonomy and botanical history of all recognised taxa is described in depth in clear English prose. All descriptions are accompanied with numerous spectacular images covering many Pinguicula taxa that have never been photographed before.</p><p></p><h2>The Remaining: Aftermath (The Remaining, 2)</h2><p>To Captain Lee Harden, the mission to rescue his countrymen and rebuild the nation seems like a distant memory. <br><br>Wounded and weaponless, he has stumbled upon a group of survivors who may be his last hope.

His sympathetic portrayal of White characters in his stories, in the plays The Days of the Turbins (The White Guard), which enjoyed great success at the Moscow Arts Theatre in 1926, and Flight (1927), and his satirical treatment of the officials of the New Economic Plan, led to growing criticism, which became violent after the play The Purple Island. He also wrote a brilliant biography of his literary hero, Jean-Baptiste Moli�re, but The Master and Margarita is generally considered his masterpiece. Fame, at home and abroad, was not to come until a quarter of a century after his death at Moscow in 1940.</p><h2>The Brass Cupcake</h2><p>Hardcover with Dustjacket. 220 pages.

Set against the seedy, sensual backdrop of a Florida Beach Town.</p><p></p><h2>Prep: A Novel</h2><p>Curtis Sittenfeld&#x2019;s debut novel, Prep, is an insightful, achingly funny coming-of-age story as well as a brilliant dissection of class, race, and gender in a hothouse of adolescent angst and ambition.<br><br>Lee Fiora is an intelligent, observant fourteen-year-old when her father drops her off in front of her dorm at the prestigious Ault School in Massachusetts. She leaves her animated, affectionate family in South Bend, Indiana, at least in part because of the boarding school&#x2019;s glossy brochure, in which boys in sweaters chat in front of old brick buildings, girls in kilts hold lacrosse sticks on pristinely mown athletic fields, and everyone sings hymns in chapel. <br><br>As Lee soon learns, Ault is a cloistered world of jaded, attractive teenagers who spend summers on Nantucket and speak in their own clever shorthand. Both intimidated and fascinated by her classmates, Lee becomes a shrewd observer of&#x2013;and, ultimately, a participant in&#x2013;their rituals and mores. As a scholarship student, she constantly feels like an outsider and is both drawn to and repelled by other loners. By the time she&#x2019;s a senior, Lee has created a hard-won place for herself at Ault. But when her behavior takes a self-destructive and highly public turn, her carefully crafted identity within the community is shattered.<br><br>Ultimately, Lee&#x2019;s experiences&#x2013;complicated relationships with teachers; intense friendships with other girls; an all-consuming preoccupation with a classmate who is less than a boyfriend and more than a crush; conflicts with her parents, from whom Lee feels increasingly distant, coalesce into a singular portrait of the painful and thrilling adolescence universal to us all.</p><p>Curtis Sittenfeld's poignant and occassionally angst-ridden debut novel <i>Prep</i> is the story of Lee Fiora, a South Bend, Indiana, teenager who wins a scholarship to the prestigious Ault school, an East Coast institution where "money was everywhere on campus, but it was usually invisible." As we follow Lee through boarding school, we witness firsthand the triumphs and tragedies that shape our heroine's coming-of-age. Yet while Sittenfeld may be a skilled storyteller, her real gift lies in her ability to expertly give voice to what is often described as the most alienating period in a young person's life: high school.<p> True to its genre, <i>Prep</i> is filled with boarding school stereotypes--from the alienated gay student to the picture perfect blond girl; the achingly earnest first-year English teacher and the dreamy star basketball player who never mentions the fact that he's Jewish. Lee's status as an outsider is further affirmed after her parents drive 18 hours in their beat-up Datsun to attend Parent's Weekend, where most of the kids "got trashed and ended up skinny-dipping in the indoor pool" at their parents' fancy hotel. Yet even as the weekend deteriorates into disaster and ends with a heartbreaking slap across the face, Sittenfeld never blames or excuses anyone; rather, she simply incorporates the experience into Lee's sense of self. ("How was I supposed to understand, when I applied at the age of thirteen, that you have your whole life to leave your family?")</p><p> By the time Lee graduates from Ault, some readers may tire of her constant worrying and self-doubting obsessions. However, every time we feel close to giving up on her, Sittenfeld reels us back in and makes us root for Lee. In doing so, perhaps we are rooting for every high school student who's ever wanted nothing more than to belong. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>Curtis Sittenfeld won the <i>Seventeen </i>magazine<i> </i>fiction writing contest in 1992, at age sixteen, and <i>The</i> <i>Mississippi Review</i>&#x2019;s annual fiction contest in 1998.

What was once instinct now needs to be learned. &#34;Until roughly ten years ago, no one ever considered it unsafe to drink directly from mountain streams.

Please think of me again as the urologist&#x2019;s daughter. . . . It may disgust you that I have brought it up at all, but who knows? Life has some problems which are basic for all of us--and about which we have a natural reticence.<br>--Katherine Hepburn, The Making of The African Queen<br>&nbsp;<br>In the mid-1800s, in the Royal Borough of Chelsea, London, an industrious young English plumber named Thomas Crapper grabbed Progress in his pipe wrench and with a number of sophisticated sanitation inventions leapfrogged ahead one hundred years. T. J. Crapper found himself challenged by problems we wrestle with yet today: water quality and water conservation. Faced with London&#x2019;s diminishing reservoirs, drained almost dry by the valve leakage and &#x201c;continuous flush systems&#x201d; of early water closets, Crapper developed the water waste preventer--the very siphonic cistern with uphill flow and automatic shut-off found in modern toilet tanks. T. Crapper &amp; Co Ld, Sanitary Engineers, Marlboro Works, Chelsea (as his name still appears on three manhole covers in Westminster Abbey) was also responsible for the laying of hundreds of miles of London&#x2019;s connecting sewers--and none too soon. The River Thames carried such quantities of rotting turds that the effluvium had driven Parliament to convene in the early morning hours to avoid a vile off-river breeze.<br>&nbsp;<br>For the Victorian ladies who complained of the WC&#x2019;s hissing and gurgling as giving away their elaborately disguised trips to the loo, Crapper installed the first silencers. Such pretenses as &#x201c;pricking the plum pudding&#x201d; or &#x201c;picking the daisies&#x201d; were foiled when a lady&#x2019;s absence was accompanied by crashing waterfalls and echoing burbles. Among Mr. Crapper&#x2019;s other claims to fame were his pear-shaped toilet seat (the forerunner of the gap-front seat) designed for men, and the posthumous addition to the English language of a vibrant new word: crapper!<br>&nbsp;<br>Clearly, T. J. Crapper was ahead of his day. Progress and time, nonetheless, are peculiar concepts. Some things in the universe--pollution, the use of euphemisms, sneaking off to the bathroom to tinkle silently down the side of the bowl, to name a few--seem to defy change, even from century to century. But there&#x2019;s been one glaring reversal in regard to crap. Our advanced twenty-first-century populace, well removed from the novelties and quirks of the first indoor WCs, finds itself having to break entirely new ground, as it were, when relieving itself outdoors. Ironically, shitting in the woods successfully--that is, without adverse environmental, psychological, or physical consequences--might be deemed genuine progress today. Take Henry, for instance (a namesake, perhaps, or even a descendant of old King Henry VIII).<br>&nbsp;<br><i>All the stories you are about to read are true (for the most part), having been extracted from dear friends and voluble strangers on various occasions, sometimes following the ingestion of copious quantities of Jose Cuervo or Yukon Jack. Only the names have been changed to protect the incommodious.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>High on a dusty escarpment jutting skyward from camp, a man named Henry, having scrambled up there and squeezed in behind what appeared to be the ideal bush for camouflage, began lowering himself precariously into a deep knee bend. Far below, just out of their bedrolls, three fellow river runners violated the profound quiet of the canyon&#x2019;s first light by poking about the commissary, cracking eggs, snapping twigs, and sloshing out the coffee pot. Through the branches, our pretzel man on the hill observed the breakfast preparations while proceeding with his own morning mission. To the earth it finally fell, round and firm, this sturdy turd. With a bit more encouragement from gravity, it rolled slowly out from between Henry&#x2019;s big boots, threaded its way through the spindly trunks of the &#x201c;ideal&#x201d; bush, and then truly taking on a mind of its own, leaped into the air like a downhill skier out at the gate.<br>&nbsp;<br>You can see the dust trail of a fast-moving pickup mushrooming off a dirt road long after you&#x2019;ve lost sight of the truck. Henry watched, wide-eyed and helpless, as a similar if smaller cloud billowed up defiantly below him, and the actual item became obscured from view. Zigging and zagging, it caromed off rough spots in the terrain. Madly it bumped and tumbled and dropped, as though making its run through a giant pinball machine. Gaining momentum, gathering its own little avalanche, round and down it spun like a buried back tire spraying up sand. All too fast it raced down the steep slope--until it became locked into that deadly slow motion common to the fleeting seconds just preceding all imminent, unalterable disasters. With one last bounce, one final effort at heavenward orbit, this unruly goof ball (followed by an arcing tail of debris) landed in a terminal thud and a rain of pebbly clatter not six inches from the bare foot of the woman measuring out coffee.<br>&nbsp;<br>With his dignity thus unraveled along sixty yards of descent, Henry in all likelihood might have come home from his first river trip firmly resolved to never again set foot past the end of the asphalt. Of course, left to his own devices and with any determination at all unless he was a total fumble-bum, Henry would have learned how to shit in the woods. Eventually. The refining of his skills by trial and error and the acquiring of grace, poise, and self-confidence--not to mention muscle development and balance--would probably have taken him about as long as it did me: years.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#x2019;t think Henry would mind our taking a closer look at his calamity. Henry can teach us a lot, and not all by poor example. Indeed, he started out on the right track by getting far enough away from camp to ensure his privacy. Straight up just wasn&#x2019;t the best choice of direction. Next, he chose a location with a view, although whether he took time to appreciate it is unknown. Usually I recommend a wide-reaching view, a landscape rolling away to distant mountain peaks and broad expanses of wild sky. But a close-in setting near a lichen-covered rock, a single wildflower, or even dried-up weeds and monotonous talus, when quietly studied, can offer inspiration of a different brand.<br>&nbsp;<br>The more time you spend in the wild, the easier it will be to reconnoiter an inspiring view. A friend of mine calls her morning exercise the Advanced Wilderness Appreciation Walk. As she strides along an irrigation canal practically devoid of vegetation, but overgrown with crumpled beer cans, has-been appliances, and rusted auto parts, she finds the morning&#x2019;s joy in the colors of the sunrise and the backlighting of a lone thistle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Essential for the outdoor neophyte is a breathtaking view. These opportunities for glorious moments alone in the presence of grandeur should be soaked up. They are soul replenishing and mind expanding. The ideal occasion for communing with nature is while you&#x2019;re peacefully sitting still--yes, shitting in the woods. The rest of the day, unless you&#x2019;re trekking solo, can quickly become cluttered with social or organizational distractions.<br>&nbsp;<br>But back to Henry, whose only major mistake was failing to dig a hole. It&#x2019;s something to think about: a small hole preventing the complete destruction of an ego. A proper hole is of great importance, not only in averting disasters such as Henry&#x2019;s, but in preventing the spread of disease and facilitating rapid decomposition. Chapter 2 in its entirety is devoted to the hole.<br>&nbsp;<br>More do&#x2019;s and don&#x2019;ts for preserving mental and physical health while shitting in the woods will become apparent as we look in on Charles. He has his own notion about clothes and pooping in the wilderness: he takes them off. Needless to say, this man hikes well away from camp and any connecting trails to a place where he feels secure about completely removing his britches and relaxing for a spell. Finding an ant-free log, he digs his hole on the opposite side from the view, sits down, scoots to the back of the log, and floats into the rhapsody that tall treetops find in the clouds. Remember this one. It&#x2019;s by far the dreamiest, most relaxing setup for shitting in the woods. A smooth, bread-loaf-shaped rock (or even your backpack in a pinch in a vacant wasteland) can be used in the same manner--for hanging your buns over the back.<br>&nbsp;<br>This seems like an appropriate spot to share a helpful technique imparted to me one day by another friend: &#x201c;Shit first, dig later.&#x201d; In puzzlement, I turned to her and as our eyes met she watched mine grow into harvest moons. But of course, &#x201c;shit first, dig later&#x201d;--that way you could never miss the hole. It was the perfect solution! Perfect, that is, for anyone with bad aim. Me? Not me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Unlike Charles, there&#x2019;s my longtime friend Elizabeth who prizes the usefulness of her clothes. While on a rattletrap bus trip through northern Mexico, the lumbering vehicle on which she rode came to a five-minute halt to compensate for the lack of a toilet on board. Like a colorful parachute descending from desert skies, Lizzie&#x2019;s voluminous skirt billowed to the earth, and she squatted down inside her own private outhouse.<br>&nbsp;<br>Occasionally it is impossible to obtain an optimal degree of privacy. Some years back, my colleague Henrietta Alice was hitchhiking along the Autobahn in Germany, where the terrain was board flat and barren. At last, unable to contain herself, she asked the driver to stop and she struck out across a field toward a knoll topped by a lone bush. There, hidden by branches and feeling safe from the eyes of traffic, she squatted and swung up the back of her skirt, securing it as a cape over her head. But Henrietta&#x2019;s rejoicing ended abruptly. Out of nowhere came a column of Boy Guides (the rear guard?) marching past her bare derri�re. <br>&nbsp;<br>Another version of Henrietta&#x2019;s story needs to be kept in mind when hiking switchbacks. I was all settled once, well off the path, completely shrouded with low-hanging branches, pants down, a soft mullein leaf in hand, when smack at me came three hikers, all men, stepping smartly along on the previous bend in the trail. Only the footway&#x2019;s ruts and roots, which held their attention, and my holding my breath like a startled squirrel saved me.<br>&nbsp;<br>There are many theories on clothes and shitting, all individual and personal. In time you will develop your own. Edwin, our next case study, has a new theory about clothes after one memorable hunting trip; whether it be to take them off or keep them on, I haven&#x2019;t figured out.</p><h2>The Warrior Lives (The Guardians of the Flame, Book 5)</h2><p>Jason Cullinane inherits a kingdom upon his father&#39;s death and a quest to rid the world of slavery, and he must battle against the mighty slavers guild while trying to discover the truth about his father</p><p><p>Joel Rosenberg was born in 1954.

A glance at the two-page chart at the beginning of the book determines your birthday "period." Next, find the period of the person who interests you--friend, parent, child, lover, or mate. The ensuing relationship dynamics are named colorfully and aptly: "Peas in a Pod," "Uncommon Intimacy," "Flexible Structures," "Few Dull Moments," and "Few Antipathies." </p><p> Describing 1,176 possibilities, <i>The Secret Language of Relationships</i> sheds light on the classic questions--the hows and whys of chemistry in relationships. Is there a prime ingredient for love at first sight, a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers of it all? An entertaining exploration of the very thing we cannot do without--each other--this wonderful volume explains why we feel the way we do about the people in our lives, and how--if necessary--to make it better.</p>Gary Goldschneider is an astrologer and coauthor of each of the books in the Secret Language series.

Dan Baum brings this kaleidoscopic portrait to life, showing us what was lost in the storm and what remains to be saved.</p><p><b>Book Description</b><br> The hidden history of a haunted and beloved city told through the intersecting lives of nine remarkable characters.<br> <p>After Hurricane Katrina, Dan Baum moved to New Orleans to write about the city&#x2019;s response to the disaster for <i>The New Yorker</i>. He quickly realized that Katrina was not the most interesting thing about New Orleans, not by a long shot. The most interesting question, which struck him as he watched residents struggling to return, was this: Why are New Orleanians&#x2014;along with people from all over the world who continue to flock there&#x2014;so devoted to a place that was, even before the storm, the most corrupt, impoverished, and violent corner of America? </p><p>Here&#x2019;s the answer. <i>Nine Lives</i> is a multivoiced biography of this dazzling, surreal, and imperiled city through the lives of nine characters over forty years and bracketed by two epic storms: Hurricane Betsy, which transformed the city in the 1960&#x2019;s, and Katrina, which nearly destroyed it. These nine lives are windows into every strata of one of the most complex and fascinating cities in the world. From outsider artists and Mardi Gras Kings to jazz-playing coroners and transsexual barkeeps, these lives are possible only in New Orleans, but the city that nurtures them is also, from the beginning, a city haunted by the possibility of disaster. All their stories converge in the storm, where some characters rise to acts of heroism and others sink to the bottom. But it is New Orleans herself&#x2014;perpetually whistling past the grave yard&#x2014;that is the story&#x2019;s real heroine.</p> <p><i>Nine Lives</i> is narrated from the points of view of some of New Orleans&#x2019;s most charismatic characters, but underpinning the voices of the city is an extraordinary feat of reporting that allows Baum to bring this kaleidoscopic portrait to life with brilliant color and crystalline detail. Readers will find themselves wrapped up in each of these individual dramas and delightfully immersed in the life of one of this country&#x2019;s last unique places, even as its ultimate devastation looms ever closer. By resurrecting this beautiful and tragic place and portraying the extraordinary lives that could have taken root only there, <i>Nine Lives</i> shows us what was lost in the storm and what remains to be saved. </p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Dan Baum on <i>Nine Lives</i></strong><br><br> Hurricane Katrina was the kind of event a reporter waits his entire life to cover. It was especially satisfying doing so for <i>The New Yorker</i>. While newspaper and television reporters chased about feverishly in their attempt to feed the insatiable daily news monster, I enjoyed the time to go deep and peel back the tragedy in all its complexity. I wrote half a dozen short &#x201c;Talk of the Town&#x201d; pieces and two long articles over the following year. <br> <p>Even working for <i>The New Yorker</i>, though, covering Katrina and its aftermath became frustrating. The longer I stayed in New Orleans, the more I understood that huge as Katrina was, it is hardly the most interesting thing about New Orleans. New Orleans is the most unusual place I&#x2019;ve ever been&#x2014;complicated, sensual, self-contradictory, hilarious, infuriating&#x2014;and it was the place itself, not the tragedy that befell it, that I wanted to write about.</p> <p>So when my wife and I thought about writing a book, it wasn&#x2019;t a &#x201c;Katrina book&#x201d; we had in mind. We finally settled on interweaving the life stories of nine New Orleanians&#x2014;rich and poor and in between, black and white and in between, male and female and in between. <i>Nine Lives</i> begins in 1965, right after the last time a big part of the city flooded during a hurricane. By this we want to say: New Orleans was there a long time before Hurricane Katrina and it will be there a long time after. Katrina doesn&#x2019;t show up in <i>Nine Lives</i> until past page 200. </p> <p>We had two guiding principles: No bad guys, and all happy endings. All nine of these people are, in their own way, heroes. And while we could have ended any of their stories on a down note, we instead end all at a moment of ascendance. There are many ways of looking at New Orleans, but this is how we chose to do so in <i>Nine Lives</i>.</p> <p>We were careful not to make <i>Nine Lives</i> the kind of "issue" book one must read to understand current events. We want people to read it for the same reason they read <i>The Kite Runner</i> or <i>The Bridges of Madison County</i>&#x2014;out of love of the characters and a warm, delicious eagerness to see their lives unfold. New Orleans is above all, a fun place, and we tried to make <i>Nine Lives</i> as much fun to read. <i>&#x2014;Dan Baum</i></p>DAN BAUM is a former staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i>, and has written for numerous other magazines and newspapers.

Aiming for the toilet through a blur of tears, she vomited until her knees shook.</p> <p>Lily had been symptomatic all day, but she knew she&#x2019;d rather eat her own foot than get sent home. Tristan would never take her to the party that night if he knew she was having another one of her epic reactions, and Lily couldn&#x2019;t afford to miss this party. Not now. Not when things between her and Tristan had so recently&#x2014;and so wonderfully&#x2014;changed.</p> <p>Tristan Corey had been Lily&#x2019;s best friend all her life. They&#x2019;d grown up together, building tent cities out of his mother&#x2019;s clean sheets and space stations out of sofa cushions. Most kids drift apart when they start to grow up&#x2014;Lily knew that. Some figure out the trick of being cool, and others stay runny-nosed geeks for the rest of high school. But to Tristan&#x2019;s credit, no matter how popular he got over the years, or how isolated Lily became as her allergies intensified and embarrassing rumors about her mother spread, he never once backed away from their pinky-swear promise to be best friends forever. He never tried to hide how close they were or pretended not to care about her because other kids thought she was strange. The only reason he rarely let her go to parties with him was because lots of kids smoked at them, and Lily&#x2019;s lungs couldn&#x2019;t handle smoke.</p> <p>Or at least, that&#x2019;s what Tristan said. Since Lily had never been to one of these parties herself she couldn&#x2019;t know for sure, but she had a sneaking suspicion that Tristan didn&#x2019;t bring her with him because he was usually going to hook up with a girl. Or several girls.</p> <p>Everyone in their graduating class knew that Tristan was the biggest player in Salem, Massachusetts. Sophomore year, he&#x2019;d come back from summer baseball camp a foot taller and achieved legendary status by dating a senior. Ever since then the girls&#x2014;and women&#x2014;of Salem had passed him around like a pair of traveling pants. Unfortunately for Lily, she&#x2019;d had a crush on Tristan since she first realized that there was a difference between boys and girls&#x2014;way before he rode the testosterone rocket to studliness. And she&#x2019;d suffered for it.</p> <p>For years, she&#x2019;d had to pretend that she was okay with being his girl Friday. They&#x2019;d run everyday errands together&#x2014;driver&#x2019;s ed, shopping for cleats, studying&#x2014;and then, inevitably, some girl would call and he&#x2019;d leave. Lily never told him how much it killed her to see the excited flush grazing his cheekbones or the hungry shine in his blue eyes when he&#x2019;d give her a distracted hug good-bye and dart off to meet his latest conquest. Tristan had never looked at Lily like that. And as she heaved monstrously into the toilet, Lily had to admit she couldn&#x2019;t blame him for taking so long to finally kiss her.</p> <p>The kiss had come out of the blue. They&#x2019;d been hanging out, watching TV, and Lily had fallen asleep on his leg like she&#x2019;d done a thousand times before. When she opened her eyes, he was staring down at her with a stunned look on his face. Then he&#x2019;d kissed her.</p> <p>That was three days ago. Even thinking about it still made Lily shake. One second she&#x2019;d been asleep, and the next Tristan was on top of her&#x2014;kissing her, touching her, and slowly moving against her. Then he&#x2019;d suddenly pulled away and tried to apologize. But Lily wasn&#x2019;t sorry at all, and she didn&#x2019;t want him to be, either.</p> <p>They hadn&#x2019;t talked about it, but the next morning he&#x2019;d held her hand at school. He&#x2019;d even given her a sweet little kiss in front of his jock friends right before practice. Lily had never dated anyone and didn&#x2019;t really know how these things worked, but she was pretty sure that by taking her to the party tonight he would be announcing to everyone that they were officially together. So Lily didn&#x2019;t care if she coughed up her spleen or sneezed out an artery. She was going to that party if it killed her.</p> <p>When she was finally done vomiting up the leaves, twigs, and roots that made up her vegan lunch, Lily staggered over to the sinks to mop her face.</p> <p>She moaned when she looked in the mirror. It was worse than she&#x2019;d expected. Her alabaster-white skin was flushed such a bright red it looked like someone had slapped her across the face. Crimson hives were rising like whip marks across her wing-like collarbones and her green eyes were glassy with fever. Quickly recounting everything she&#x2019;d eaten that day, she couldn&#x2019;t think of what could have caused such a runaway reaction. Her allergy must have been caused by something she couldn&#x2019;t see, like the chemicals they used to clean the school, but she couldn&#x2019;t really be sure of that.</p> <p>Lily twisted her slippery strawberry-colored curls up close to her scalp and stabbed the thick mass into a messy French twist with a pencil. She took off her SAVE THE WHALES T-shirt and bent over a sink in her bra, trying to coax colder water out of the lukewarm tap by batting it with her fingertips. She splashed the not-quite-cool-enough water over the angry rash that was rising like a hot tide up her hyperreactive body.</p> <p>The bell rang, signaling the end of her lunch period, and Lily had no choice but to reach into her bag for one of her many emergency kits. She dug past a bottle of quick-dissolve steroid pills and her inhaler, and went straight for the Epipen. She took the green cap off the tube of sterile plastic and jabbed the tip through the jeans covering her thigh, gritting her teeth against the painful stab.</p> <p>Technically, she wasn&#x2019;t supposed to use her Epipen except in a life-threatening situation, but since she had no idea what was causing such a violent reaction, she figured it was better to be safe than sorry. As the medicine cocktail from the Epipen flooded her system, Lily&#x2019;s symptoms began to diminish. Her eyes stopped watering and her vision cleared. She shivered violently as the adrenaline from the shot rushed through her system, then realized that her entire upper body was wet. Hands shaking with the jitters, she dabbed at herself with some paper towels and put on her T-shirt as the bell rang a second time, signaling the start of the next class.</p> <p>Lily ran out of the girls&#x2019; room, up the stairs, and thundered down the nearly empty hallway to Mr. Carnello&#x2019;s classroom just before he closed the door.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sorry, Mr. Carn.&#x201d; She panted as she ducked past him.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you alright?&#x201d; Mr. Carnello asked her, glancing down at Lily&#x2019;s top and then quickly away.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sure. I just had a&nbsp;&#x2026; thing,&#x201d; she mumbled distractedly, and darted into the room.</p> <p>Tristan looked up from his spot at their lab table and narrowed his eyes at her as she made her way over to him. She noticed a couple of people looking at her strangely as she sat down. She tried to smile back at them in friendly way, but they all looked away from her without making eye contact.</p> <p>&#x201c;Lily,&#x201d; Tristan hissed at her.</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she hissed back.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why are your boobs wet?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;My what?&#x201d; Lily looked down at her T-shirt and saw that the white material was completely transparent where her soggy bra had soaked through. Mortified, she crossed her arms over her chest. She could hear a few guys snickering in the corner and saw Tristan&#x2019;s head spin around, silencing them with a look.</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you need a moment to collect yourself, Miss Proctor?&#x201d; Mr. Carnello asked kindly.</p> <p>&#x201c;No. We&#x2019;re good,&#x201d; Tristan answered for Lily as he quickly pulled his sweater over his head.</p> <p>The shirt he was wearing underneath hiked up accidentally as he did so, and a few girls whispered excitedly at the glimpse of rippling muscles and velvety skin. Tristan helped Lily into his sweater as if he didn&#x2019;t even hear them. Considering the fact that he just had to walk past most girls to make them groan out loud, he probably didn&#x2019;t. But Lily heard them, and felt herself flush with even more heat as she resisted the urge to strangle them.</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you have a fever?&#x201d; he asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;I always have a fever,&#x201d; Lily replied grumpily, which they both knew was true.</p> <p>Lily&#x2019;s body ran hot&#x2014;about 102 degrees on a normal day. On a bad day, her fever could shoot up as high as 111 degrees. The doctors had no idea how she&#x2019;d survived some of her worst attacks, but then again, they had no idea about a lot of things where Lily was concerned.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; replied Tristan, pointing accusingly at the spot of blood on her jeans where she&#x2019;d impaled herself with the Epipen. &#x201c;Do you need me to take you home? Or the hospital?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>fine</i>,&#x201d; she replied emphatically. &#x201c;Really. I feel great.&#x201d; She paused and smiled ruefully. &#x201c;Well, apart from the whole wet-boobs-in-class thing.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lily gave him a saucy look and nudged his arm, brushing the whole thing off. After everything that people had said about her and her family, a wet T-shirt was the least of Lily&#x2019;s problems. Tristan&#x2019;s big blue eyes sparkled and his light-brown hair fell across his forehead as he ducked his head with quiet laughter. He had a million little gestures like this that left her star struck. He was almost too pretty to look at sometimes, and Lily couldn&#x2019;t believe how lucky she was that he was finally hers.</p> <p>&#x201c;Pay attention to Mr. Carn,&#x201d; she chastised, like Tristan had been the one to disrupt class. He nudged her back and they focused on the lecture.</p> <p>&#x201c;If any symbol fits the universe better than this one&#x201d;&#x2014;Mr. Carnello spun to his projector and drew the sideways figure eight that represented infinity&#x2014;&#x201c;it would be this one.&#x201d; He drew an equal sign. &#x201c;Newton proved that if you hit a ball with a known amount of force, that force doesn&#x2019;t disappear. It&#x2019;s turned into kinetic energy, and the ball flies a distance that you can measure with accuracy. Why? Because energy in&#x201d;&#x2014;he tapped one side of the equal sign&#x2014;&#x201c;is equal to the energy out.&#x201d; He finished by tapping the other side of the equal sign. &#x201c;So. Energy changes. Matter can even change into energy&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll get to Einstein&#x2019;s E equals mc squared later&#x2014;but you can&#x2019;t make something out of nothing. This is the first law of thermodynamics. Now! <i>Thermo</i>, which is Greek for &#x2018;heat,&#x2019; and <i>dynamics</i>, from the Greek <i>dynamikos,</i> which means &#x2018;power.&#x2019; Heat and power are two halves of the same whole.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mr. Carnello began to scribble furiously as he mumbled to himself. Lily and Tristan looked at each other and grinned. They both loved science. In fact, Tristan had scored higher on his Biology Achievement Test than anyone else in the state that year, and he was seriously thinking about enrolling as a premed student in one of the Ivy League schools that he would apply to this winter. It was only early November, and seniors still had another month or two to pick colleges, declare their majors, and basically figure out the rest of their lives before they all turned eighteen. Lily was sure Tristan had already decided to be a doctor someday. After spending so much time visiting her at Mass General when she was having one of her more severe attacks, he certainly knew his way around a hospital.</p> <p>Lily wasn&#x2019;t particularly interested in being a doctor herself, but she studied all the sciences with a passion. She had always been able to understand physics intuitively, and on the days she was feeling particularly put upon, Lily believed this was because her body was a wacky science experiment gone wrong. Every year, Lily&#x2019;s ailments grew worse, and not even the cadre of specialists in Boston she went to see every month knew how to treat her. She&#x2019;d always dreamed of chaining herself to an endangered redwood tree or participating in a long sit-in to stop animal testing, but the truth was, her body would never let her do those things. She probably wouldn&#x2019;t even be able to live on campus when she went to college next year&#x2014;if she was healthy enough to attend college at all.</p> <p>A wave of anxiety overtook her at the thought of Tristan going far away to college. Harvard and Brown were close enough for him to commute easily, but what if he decided to go to Columbia&#x2014;or worse, Cornell? Ithaca was a six-hour drive from Salem.</p> <p>As Mr. Carnello delved into the finer points of thermodynamics, the adrenaline from the Epipen shot abandoned Lily all at once, leaving her with a killer headache and a raging case of paranoia about her changing status in Tristan&#x2019;s life. She resisted the urge to rub her temples and beg Tristan to stay in Boston. Every time Tristan looked over at her to see if she was okay, Lily smiled brightly to prove how great she felt. What she really needed was about a gallon of water to wash away the bitter film that was coating the inside of her mouth, but she&#x2019;d have to wait until after class to go to the bubbler or Tristan would know she felt sick. Lily nearly sighed with relief when the bell rang.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thanks for the loaner.&#x201d; She pulled Tristan&#x2019;s sweater off and handed it to him. &#x201c;I think my boobs are sufficiently dry now.&#x201d; She fanned her flushed face. &#x201c;Actually, I think they&#x2019;re cooked. I was roasting all period.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And I was freezing.&#x201d; Tristan gratefully put his sweater back on with a shiver. &#x201c;Mr. Carn always keeps his room so damn cold.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The half-dissected cats like it better that way.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just lucky I love you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, right. You just didn&#x2019;t want me flashing the whole room!&#x201d; Lily exclaimed a bit too loudly.</p> <p>She watched Tristan grab his stuff and hurry out of the room, not even thinking twice about his choice of words. He said he loved her every now and again. It didn&#x2019;t mean the same thing to him as it did to her, and Lily knew it. But she also knew that he did care deeply about her, which made the situation all the more confusing. Since their steamy episode on the couch, Tristan hadn&#x2019;t tried anything sexier than a few chaste kisses and a lot of hand-holding. He loved her&#x2014;Lily had known that for years&#x2014;but he just didn&#x2019;t seem to be all the crazy about her body.</p> <p>Not that she had a bad body, Lily thought as she grabbed a sip from the bubbler and then followed Tristan to their side-by-side lockers. Sure, she had skin that was much too fair for the current style and she was painfully skinny, but even she was aware of the fact that she had a great face. Well, Lily conceded, she had a great face when it wasn&#x2019;t leaking snot or covered in hives, which wasn&#x2019;t very often. And the hair was a problem. Bright red, thicker than polar bear fur and curly as scissor-skinned ribbons on a birthday present, Lily&#x2019;s hair was a force to be reckoned with. She wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if it could be seen from space, and she spent most of her time pinning it back, pulling it up, and generally trying to convince it not to eat her face.</p> <p>Lily hated her hair, probably because it reminded her so much of her mother&#x2019;s. Her big sister, Juliet, had pin-straight locks in a perfectly respectable shade of brown, but not Lily. Oh, no. On top of having to wear a battalion of medic-alert bracelets that proclaimed her freakiness to the world, Lily had also been saddled with her mom&#x2019;s crazy hair.</p> <p>Lily fervently hoped she hadn&#x2019;t gotten her mom&#x2019;s crazy mind to go with it.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you sure you want to go to your last class?&#x201d; Tristan asked skeptically as he watched Lily pull her Spanish textbook out of her locker. &#x201c;I could get a pass and drive you home right now,&#x201d; he offered.</p> <p>&#x201c;What for?&#x201d; Lily said brightly.</p> <p>Tristan straightened to his full height of six foot two and turned toward her. He reached out with one of his long, supple arms and boxed her in against the wall of lockers. She went still and looked up at him. Tristan was one of those rare guys whose skin always managed to look dewy and fresh, like every inch of him was utterly kissable.</p> <p>&#x201c;No jokes. No acting tough,&#x201d; he said, easing closer to her until his thighs rested on hers. Tristan brushed her cheek with the backs of his fingers. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to co...</p></p><h2>The BILL JAMES GUIDE TO BASEBALL MANAGERS: From 1870 to Today</h2><p>Offers profiles of top managers, includes essays on everything from Casey Stengel&#39;s impact on attendance to relief pitching, and provides sidebars, statistics, and snapshots of each decade</p><p>James has built a career on finding the art and wisdom in baseball&#39;s numbers. Here he answers--in words as well as the numbers to back them up--everything you&#39;ve ever wanted to know about dugout skippers, from the game&#39;s dinosaur days in the 1870s right up to today. Dividing his book into decade stretches, James examines the best managers of each time period, analyzing their contributions, detailing their styles, pointing out quirks, dissecting strengths and weaknesses, and comparing them with others. Along the way, he adds some fascinating essays--on the Dodger farm system, for example, the influence of Ned Hanlon, and the worst single managerial job of all time. Like all of James&#39;s work, it&#39;s filled with charts and statistics that open doors to both the managerial mind and baseball&#39;s inner workings. --Jeff Silverman, Sports editorHow do you determine excellence in a baseball manager? After citing won-lost records and World Series appearances, fans are reduced to subjective references to motivating players and setting strategy. Statistical analyst James, famous for the <i>Baseball Abstract</i>, does his best to provide a basis for comparing, say, Walter Alston with Casey Stengel. The book is loosely structured by decade, with James analyzing each era's best, worst, and most influential skippers on the basis of such elaborate criteria as, Does the manager platoon his players or use a set lineup? Does he prefer veterans over young players? Does he like his pitchers to complete their starts or is he a "quick hook" ? As always, James' opinions are thought provoking and entertainingly expressed. It's been too long since his last book-length collection of essays, and this volume's appearance in a spring of renewed interest in the grand old game is perfect timing. Expect significant interest in a fine book. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i></p><h2>Southern Living 2008 Annual Recipes: Every Single Recipe from 2008</h2><p>No one knows the South better than <i>Southern Living, </i>and no one knows food better than the magazine's Test Kitchens Professionals and Foods Editors.

The book offers a view of the very earliest works, few of which have been reproduced, and then goes on to the posters, illustrations, and graphic series, offering a detailed examination of the themes, language, and experimental techniques that have made Lichtenstein an enduring figure for over four decades. The catalogue provides an excellent key, chronology, exhibition history, and concordance, and each entry has a wealth of information, including the runs for works produced in printmaking workshops.

Unlike fellow pop artists Andy Warhol and James Rosenquist, Lichtenstein is as much a printmaker as a painter. As Cortlett (coauthor, A Graphic Muse: Prints by Contemporary Women) notes, the artist's work revitalizes the "exhausted symbols of popular culture" in benday dots, heavy black outlines and abstracted reflections, woodgrain and architecture, a "potent syntax" that the book reproduces faithfully.

Albert reaches out the window to check the weather. But from the moment a twig lands smack in the palm of his hand, life is never the same. <br> In her first picture book, Donna Jo Napoli invents a magical and inspiring tale that will capture the heart of any reader who has loved a pet. Jim LaMarche creates an endearing character in Albert and a classic setting for the miraculous new world that unfolds around him.<br></p><p>Every day Albert sticks his hand out the window of his apartment to check the weather. Every day he decides it's too cold, too hot, too wet, too breezy, and goes back to sitting at his table, drinking tomato juice, doing card tricks, or listening to baseball games on the radio. Until one day when he works his hand out through the grillwork over his window--plop! A cardinal drops a twig in his palm. Before he knows it, Albert is stranded, holding a brand new nest in his hand. The days go by, eggs are laid, the papa cardinal starts feeding berries to Albert, and, inevitably, chicks hatch. Meanwhile, Albert is slowly developing a different take on life. His previously protected world opens up as he witnesses the highs and lows of nature's course.<p> In this odd little story, award-winning young adult novelist Donna Jo Napoli (<i>Zel</i>, <i>Spinners</i>, etc.) takes her first stab at writing a picture book. It's quirky, it's whimsical... It's a little perplexing. The moral, apparently, is that we need to seize life by the lapels, take the good with the bad, not hide our heads underground. But this message may apply more strongly to adults, especially as the protagonist himself is a young man. Still, children will love the idea of a bird building its nest in someone's hand. With colored pencils, Jim LaMarche creates luminous full-page illustrations with charming details and intriguing angles.

Smart, grave, tender, and fiercely alive, these poems vibrate with the hushed power of just-before-the-storm: magnetic, charged, eerily clear."&#x2015;Lisa Olstein, author of Little Stranger</p><p>"What do we do in the face of this unknowing? Perhaps the greatest strength of Christle's work is she doesn't pretend to know the solution to such an unanswerable problem. She wrestles with possibilities, but the struggle is never solved absolutely. Instead, we see that struggle enacted, challenging our sense of self and our relationship to knowledge, and Christle earns authority and the trust of her readers not by conquering unknowing but by accepting it."&#x2015;Andy Chen, <i>Colorado Review</i></p><p>"[Christle] is in no way resigned to the inefficiency of language, she is merely attempting to put it in its place and to make that place more real than language can be. This is what good poetry means to me."&#x2015;Heather Brown, <i>The Volta</i></p><p>"These are not conventional narrative poems, and, as with her other books, Christle provides a sense of lyric exigency that is both humorous and necessary, leaving little excess but comprising a world that leaves readers with ways to get in. These are poems of habitation, in the sense that a linguist would dwell in language."&#x2015;Laura Carter, <i>Jacket 2</i></p><p>"Readers will recall Dickinson's defiant, but also despairing, verdict: 'The Brain is Wider than the Sky.' And just as Dickinson catalogs the distance between perception and 'the things themselves,' so too Christle recognizes the gulf between experience and knowledge. Christle is at her best holding our feet (and hers) to the fire, and Heliopause, for the most part, keeps the heat up."&#x2015;Tyrone Williams, <i>Rain Taxi</i></p><p>"Heliopause&nbsp;signals a new direction for Christle, one that she embarks upon skillfully.&nbsp; [She] turns to speak about the terrified world in poems notable for their clear, earnest, and committed voice."&#x2015;Julie Swarstad Johnson, <i>Harvard Review</i></p><p>"'On the sidewalk / I'm watching a full-length / animation the trees made / w/technical direction / from the sun,' writes Heather Christle in her beautiful shadow-play of a book, Heliopause. These twenty-first-century allegories of the cave disclose 'the dark uncovered places / of now becoming a then.' Christle's work makes that dark shine."&#x2015;Srikanth Reddy, author of Voyager</p><p>"In Heather Christle's fourth volume, her fast-paced, lambent voice gains gravity by exploring spaceChristle has always found humor in unexpected places, but the poems of this volume seek out the sadness that undergirds humor, exploring the lacunae between levity and loss, the alphabet and the objects the words represent, life and what remains after death."&#x2015;Kristen Bartholomew Ortega, <i>Boston Review</i></p><p>"[R]ising star Heather Christle attempts to transcend our solar system with the aptly titled Heliopause. Her fourth book, and second from Wesleyan, probes the boundaries of the known and unknown like a poetic Voyager 1."&#x2015;Alex Crowley, <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Proof that the world of poetry chugs along with quiet but spirited strength, Christle publishes her fourth collection, filled with imagination and sharp personal moments."&#x2015;Tiffany Gilbert, <i>TimeOut New York</i></p><p>"In the end, the magic is what it's all about. Say what you want about intent or position, but the point is, at its heart, here is a book easily larger than the sum of all its parts; it widens the rift between fantasy and reality in a way that makes the world somehow both clearer and more mysterious, a space outside of outer space itself."&#x2015;Blake Butler, <i>Vice</i></p></p><h2>Classic Piano Rags: Complete Original Music for 81 Piano Rags</h2><p>Best ragtime music (1897&#x2013;1922) by the greatest ragtime composers of the age: Scott Joplin, James Scott, Joseph Lamb, Tom Turpin,&nbsp;plus 11 more.

This is a book for those who like their gossip explicit and in large quantities, and who aren't bothered by little details like verifiable attribution. (The vast majority of quotes in this book are from "a member of the Wales household," "a lady-in-waiting," "a courtier," and most ironically of all, "a friend.") Lady Campbell claims to be the person whom Diana first approached to write the tell-all biography that Andrew Morton was later to author. And though she turned down that opportunity, this is her second publication to cash in on her "insider status" (<i>Diana in Private</i> was her first), which is seemingly a reference to her title by marriage and a casual acquaintance with the princess. <p> With its paucity of named sources, it's probably impossible to authoritatively separate fact from fiction in <i>The Real Diana</i>, though it does seem that what with affairs, petty vengeances, and temper tantrums, Di would have had little time left for her courtly duties. Campbell's style is lively enough, and she has some interesting insights into the modern British aristocracy and its unconventional values.

This study explains how and why cities took the shape they did. Professor Kostof focuses on a number of themes - organic patterns, the grid, the city as diagram, the grand manner and the skyline - and interprets the hidden order of urban patterns. Photographs, historical views and specially commissioned drawings depict a global mosaic of citybuilding: the shaping of medieval Siena; the creation of New Delhi as the crown of the Raj; the remodelling of Moscow as the self-styled capital of world socialism and the transformation of the skyline as religious and civic symbols yield to the towers of corporate business.</p><p>Spiro Kostof (1936-1991) was a professor of Architectural History at the University of California at Berkley, and also taught at M.I.T., and at Yale, Columbia, and Rice universities. His many books include The Architect: Chapters in The History of the Profession (1977) and A History of Architecture: Settings and Rituals (1985), now a standard text. He edited America by Design (1987), the companion to a five-part television series that he presented. Kostof also published The City Shaped with Bulfinch Press in 1991.<br>Kostof has done it again; in prolific fashion he has produced another standard textbook. This time his subject is cities rather than architecture, which he covered in A History of Architecture: Settings and Rituals ( LJ 6/1/85). This book will appeal especially to designers, architects, and planners, as it organizes its subject matter according to what form it takes (grids, diagrams, skylines, etc.) rather than chronologically, topically, or typologically, as do other surveys of urbanism. Kostof is a master tour guide, blessed with an easy writing style, a piquant, welcoming mind, and a worldwide mastery of his subject matter. This book is certain to become a classic in its field comparable to Lewis Mumford's Culture of Cities (1933) and Mark Girouard's Cit ies and People ( LJ 10/15/85).<br><i>- Peter Kaufman, Boston Coll.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Last Guardian (Warcraft, Book 3)</h2><p>In the mist-shrouded haze of the past, long before the beginning of recorded time, there stood the world of Azeroth. Every kind of magical being strode the countryside among the tribes of man, and all was at peace -- until the arrival of the demons and horrors of the Burning Legion and their baneful Lord Sargeras, dark god of chaotic magic.

Torn by two destinies, Medivh's struggle against the malice within him became one with the fate of Azeroth itself...and changed the world forever. <br> <b>THE LAST GUARDIAN</b> <br> An original tale of magic, warfare, and heroism based on the bestselling, award-winning electronic game from Blizzard Entertainment.</p><p><b>Jeff Grubb</b> is an author of novels, short stories and comics and a computer and role-playing game designer in the fantasy genre.

He lives in Pittsburg, PA.<b>Prologue: The Lonely Tower</b> <p> The larger of the two moons had risen first this evening, and now hung pregnant and silver-white against a clear, star-dappled sky. Beneath the lambent moon the peaks of the Redridge Mountains strained for the sky. In the daylight the sun picked out hues of magenta and rust among the great granite peaks, but in the moonlight they were reduced to tall, proud ghosts. To the west lay the Forest of Elwynn, its heavy canopy of greatoaks and satinwoods running from the foothills to the sea. To the east, the bleak swamp of the Black Morass spread out, a land of marshes and low hills, bayous and backwaters, failed settlements and lurking danger. A shadow passed briefly across the moon, a raven-sized shadow, bearing for a hole in the heart of the mountain. </p> <p> Here a chunk had been pulled from the fastness of the Redridge Range, leaving behind a circular vale. Once it might have been the site of some primeval celestial impact or the memory of an earth-shaking explosion, but the aeons had worn the bowl-shaped crater into a series of steep-edged, rounded hillocks which were now cradled by the steeped mountains surrounding them. None of the ancient trees of Elwynn could reach its altitude, and the interior of the ringed hills was barren save for weeds and tangled vines. </p> <p> At the center of the ringed hills lay a bare tor, as bald as the pate of a Kul Tiras merchant lord. Indeed the very way the hillock rose steeply, than gentled to a near-level slope at its apex, was similar in shape to a human skull. Many had noted it over the years, though only a few had been sufficiently brave, or powerful, or tactless to mention it to the property's owner. </p> <p> At the flattened peak of the tor rose an ancient tower, a thick, massive protrusion of white stone and dark mortar, a man-made eruption that shot effortlessly into the sky, scaling higher than the surrounding hills, lit like a beacon by the moonlight. There was a low wall at the base of the tower surrounding a bailey, and within those walls the tumbledown remains of a stable and a smithy, but the tower itself dominated all within the ringed hills. </p> <p> Once this place was called Karazhan. Once it was home of the last of the mysterious and secretive Guardians of Tirisfal. Once it was a living place. Now it was simply abandoned and timelost. </p> <p> There was silence upon the tower but not a stillness. In the night's embrace quiet shapes flitted from window to window, and phantoms danced along the balconies and parapets. Less than ghosts, but more than memories, these were nothing less than pieces of the past that had become unstuck from the flow of time. These shadows of the past had been pried loose by the madness of the tower's owner, and were now condemned to play out their histories again and again, in the silence of the abandoned tower. Condemned to play but denied of any audience to appreciate them. </p> <p> Then in the silence, there was the soft scrape of a booted foot against stone, then another. A flash of movement beneath the lambent moon, a shadow against the white stone, a flutter of a tattered, red-hued cloak in the cool night air. A figure walked along the topmost parapet, on the crenellated uppermost spire that years before had served as an observatory. </p> <p> The parapet door into the observatory screeched open on ancient hinges, then stopped, frozen by rust and the passage of time. The cloaked figure paused a moment, then placed a finger on the hinge, and muttered a few choice words. The door swung open silently, the hinges made as if new. The trespasser allowed himself a smile. </p> <p> The observatory was empty now, what tools that remained smashed and abandoned. The trespassing figure, almost as silent as a ghost himself, picked up a crushed astrolabe, its scale twisted in some now-forgotten rage. Now it is merely a heavy piece of gold, inert and useless in his hands. </p> <p> There was other movement in the observatory, and the trespasser looked up. Now a ghostly figure stood nearby, near one of the many windows. The ghost/non-ghost was an broad-shouldered man, hair and beard once dark but now going to a premature gray at the edges. The figure was one of the shards of the past, unglued and now repeating its task, regardless of whether it had observers or not. For the moment, the dark-haired man held the astrolabe, the unbroken twin to the one in the trespasser's hands, and fiddled with a small knob along one side. A moment, a check, and a twitch of the knob. His dark brows furrowed over ghostly green eyes. A second moment, another check, and another twitch. Finally, the tall, imposing figure sighed deeply and placed the astrolabe on a table that was no longer there, and vanished. </p> <p> The trespasser nodded. Such hauntings were common even in the days when Karazhan was inhabited, though now, stripped of the control (and the madness) of their master, they had become more brazen. Yet these shards of the past belonged here, while he did not. He was the interloper, not they. </p> <p> The trespasser crossed the room to its staircase leading down, while behind him the older man flickered back into the view and repeated his action, sighting his astrolabe on a planet that had long since moved to other parts of the sky. </p> <p> The trespasser moved down through the tower, crossing levels to reach other stairs and other hallways. No door was shut to him, even those locked and bolted, or sealed by rust and age. A few words, a touch, a gesture and the fetters flew loose, the rust dissolved into ruddy piles, the hinges restored. In one or two places ancient wards still glowed, potent despite their age. He paused before them for a moment, considering, reflecting, searching his memory for the correct counter-sign. He spoke the correct word, made the correct motion with his hands, shattered the weak magic that remained, and passed on. </p> <p> As he moved through the tower, the phantoms of the past grew more agitated and more active. Now with a potential audience, it seemed that these pieces of the past wished to play themselves out, if only to be made free of this place. Any sound they once possessed had long-since eroded away, leaving only their images moving through the halls. </p> <p> The interloper passed an ancient butler in dark livery, the frail old man shuffling slowly down the empty hallway, carrying a silver tray and wearing a set of horse-blinders. The interloper passed through the library, where a green-fleshed young woman stood with her back to him, pouring over an ancient tome. He passed through a banquet hall, at one end a group of musicians playing soundlessly, dancers twirling in a gavotte. At the other end a great city burned, its flames beating ineffectively against the stone walls and rotting tapestries. The trespasser moved through the silent flames, but his face grew drawn and tense as he witnessed once more the mighty city of Stormwind burn around him. </p> <p> In one room three young men sat around a table and told now-unknown lies. Metal mugs were scattered on the table's surface as well as beneath it. The trespasser stood watching this image for a long time, until a phantom taverness brought another round. Then he shook his head and pressed on. </p> <p> He reached nearly the ground level, and stepped out on a low balcony that hung precariously to the wall, like a wasps' nest over the main entrance. There, in the wide space before the tower, between the main entrance and a now-collapsed stables across the bailey, stood a single ghostly image, lonely and separated. It did not move like the others, but rather stood there, waiting, tentative. A piece of the past that had not been released. A piece that was waiting for him. </p> <p> The immobile image was of a young man with a skunk stripe of white running through his dark, untidy head of hair. The straggling fragments of a beard, newly grown, clung to his face. A battered rucksack lay at the youth's feet, and he held a red-sealed letter with a deathlike grip. </p> <p> This was well and truly no ghost, the trespasser knew, though the owner of this image may yet be dead, fallen in combat beneath a foreign sun. This was a memory, a shard of the past, trapped like an insect in amber, waiting for its release. Waiting for his arrival. </p> <p> The trespasser sat on the stonework ledge of the balcony and looked out, beyond the bailey, beyond the hillock, and beyond the ringed hills. There was silence in the moonlight, as the mountains themselves seemed to be holding their breath, waiting for him. </p> <p> The trespasser lifted a hand and intoned a series of chanted words. Softly came the rhymes and rhythms the first time, then louder, and finally louder still, shattering the calm. In the distance wolves picked up his chant and cast it back in howling counterpoint. </p> <p> And the image of the ghostly youth, its feet seemingly trapped in mud, took a deep breath, hoisted his rucksack of secrets to his shoulder, and slogged his way toward the main entrance of Medivh's Tower. </p> <p> Copyright � 2002 by Blizzard Entertainment.

If literary fiction in its purest form is meant to be an accurate reflection of human experience and its inevitable ambiguities, Alexie skillfully offers us this in <i>Blasphemy</i>. . . .

Now, many books later, best-selling Alexie has created a substantial, big-hearted, and potent collection that combines an equal number of new and selected stories to profound effect. In these comfort-zone-destroying tales, including the masterpiece, 'War Dances,' his characters grapple with racism, damaging stereotypes, poverty, alcoholism, diabetes, and the tragic loss of languages and customs. Questions of authenticity and identity abound. . . . Alexie writes with arresting perception in praise of marriage, in mockery of hypocrisy, and with concern for endangered truths and imperiled nature.

A probing biography that explains Sherman&#39;s style of warfare and the threads of self-possession and insecurity that made up his character. Photos.</p><p>John F. Marszalek is professor of history at Mississippi State University.Sherman taught America that "War is hell" as he swept through Georgia and the Carolinas to destroy the Confederates' will to resist. The roots of Sherman's philosophy of total war and of his enigmatic personality have fascinated historians since the Civil War, when Sherman was thought both insane and brilliant. Now, in Marszalek's ( Grover Cleveland, Greenwood Pr., 1988) full and fascinating biography, we get the whole man--a warrior who hated killing but carried war to civilians; a foster son craving paternal approval who led hardened men; a writer and talker who preferred action to words. Marszalek finds the key to Sherman in his search for order, both in a private life troubled by uncertain financial prospects and relations and in a civil war, and later Indian wars, where old West Point verities did not apply. That Sherman was a troubled soul who sought to make his family appreciate his trials and triumphs is evident in the small cache of Sherman letters published for the first time in Joseph Ewing's Sherman at War (Morningside, 1992). The new letters notwithstanding, Marszalek's psychobiographical musings about Sherman's inner self doubtless will cause some historians to blush. But the rich historical contextual material on everything from Western finances, Indian wars in Florida and the West, and Civil War military policy make Marszalek's Sherman real and powerful.

Writing not long after dinosaurs first invaded the popular imagination, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle spins a yarn about an expedition of two scientists, a big-game hunter, and a journalist (the narrator) to a volcanic plateau high over the vast Amazon rain forest.

They enshrine the history of a people, most of whom have lived far from the capital, court and Parliament. These people - their art, architecture and faith - are seldom recorded or celebrated. The parish church is their public monument.<br>Simon Jenkins has travelled the length and breadth of England to select his thousand best churches. They are of all periods and denominations, though most are medieval foundations. Organized by county, each church is described, often with delightful asides, and is given a star-rating from one to five. The four- and five-star churches are listed as the 'hundred best' . The county sections are prefaced by a map locating each church and illustrated with photographs by Paul Barker from the Country Life Archive.</p><p>Simon Jenkins writes a twice-weekly column for The Times and a weekly column for the London Evening Standard. In the course of his career he has edited both the Evening Standard and The Times.This excellent county-by-county survey celebrates the classic beauty, quirky individuality, and, in most cases, sublime resilience of England's parish churches, large and small, old and new, in city, town, and village. Jenkins, a veteran journalist and prolific author, shares his knowledge of the artistic and historic treasures stored in English churches with the gusto of a connoisseur, leavening his precise and vivid descriptions of each church's features with wry observations about the foibles of man, medieval or modern. He also ranks the churches using a five-star system. The text does assume some familiarity with the terminology of church architecture and the regions of England; fortunately, a glossary clarifies most terms, and maps and brief introductions to each county should help non-Anglophiles get their bearings. The general introduction outlines English church history and explains the criteria for evaluating the churches, emphasizing accessibility. Over 100 stunning color photographs from the archive of Country Life magazine, along with two indexes, one of artists and one of places, add to the appeal of this irresistibly browsable volume. Students of history, religion, and architecture will enjoy the lively insights, while the armchair traveler will be taken on a delightful odyssey across time and space.

Lackey's latest created world (illustrated by husband Dixon) predates the setting of her Valdemar series by a millennium but never quite lives up to its expanded possibilities. The gryphon of the title is the charismatic Skandranon, leader of the gryphons, a race of birds just evolving into awareness. After establishing this intriguing premise, however, the tale soon bogs down in fantasy cliches as the main characters fight a standard war against the forces of evil. Although some of the novel's elements, like Skandranon's human friend Amberdrake, suggest a possible complexity, the plot is predictable and the overwritten battle scenes are difficult to follow. In the end, the evil Mage of Black Fire is destroyed, nearly everyone else lives and the chaotic magic of prehistory is tamed. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Penguin English Library Mary Barton</h2><p>The Penguin English Library Edition of Mary Barton by Elizabeth Gaskell &#34;The rich know nothing of the trials of the poor; I say, if they don&#39;t know, they ought to know.

Although Holtby greatly admires Woolf's art, she considers its limitations as an elite form that ignores the material conditions of everyday life and the consequent social responsibility expected of the novel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choosing to write about Woolf as 'the author whose art seemed most of all removed from anything I could ever attempt, and whose experience was most alien to my own,' Holtby has written a candid appreciation of the complex, groundbreaking work of a contemporary writer at the height of her career. <br>Winifred Holtby was a novelist, journalist and social reformer, who campaigned for the causes of peace and sexual and racial equality.

Otherwise it is false.</i>&#x2014;�Ernest Becker, <i>The Denial of DeathI will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul makes its boast in the LORD; let the af�flicted hear and be glad. O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together! (Psalm 34:1&#x2013;�3)</i></p><p>Suffering is everywhere, unavoidable, and its scope often overwhelms. If you spend one hour reading this book, more than five children throughout the world will have died from abuse and violence during that time. If you give the entire day to reading, more than one hundred children will have died violently. But this is, of course, only one of innu�merable forms and modes of suffering. Thousands die from traffic acci�dents or cancer every hour, and hundreds of thousands learn that their loved ones are suddenly gone. That is comparable to the population of a small city being swept away every day, leaving families and friends devastated in the wake.</p><p>When enormous numbers of deaths happen in one massive event&#x2014;�such as the 1970 Bhola cyclone in Bangladesh, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, or the 2010 Haiti earthquake&#x2014;�each of which killed 300,000 or more at once&#x2014;�it makes headlines around the world and everyone reels from the devastation. But statistics are misleading. Such historic disasters do not really change the suffering rate. Tens of thousands of people die every day in unexpected tragedies, and hundreds of thou�sands around them are crushed by grief and shock. The majority of them trigger no headlines because pain and misery is the norm in this world.</p><p>Shakespeare understood this when he wrote:</p><p>Each new morn</p><p>New widows howl, new orphans cry,</p><p>New sorrows strike heaven on the face.</p><p>Evil and suffering are so pervasive that the statistics I just recounted hardly make us blink. Yet we must blink. Author Ernest Becker spoke about the danger of denying the misery of life and the randomness of suffering. When we hear of a tragedy, there is a deep-�seated psycholog�ical defense mechanism that goes to work. We think to ourselves that such things happen to other people, to poor people, or to people who do not take precautions. Or we tell ourselves that if only we get the right people into office and get our social systems right, nothing like this will happen again.</p><p>But Becker believed such thinking fails to &#x201c;take life seriously&#x201d; or to admit the &#x201c;lived truth of the terror of creation . . . ?of the rumble of panic underneath everything.&#x201d; That panic comes from death. Death is irreducibly unpredictable and inexorable.</p><p>The same message comes through in an article written in <i>The New York Times Magazine </i>during the time of the &#x201c;Beltway Sniper,&#x201d; who was shooting people in the Washington, DC, area in what appeared to be a completely random way, without concern for race or age. Ann Patchett wrote:</p><p>We are always looking to make some sort of sense out of murder in order to keep it safely at bay: I do not fit the de�scription; I do not live in that town; I would never have gone to that place, known that person. But what happens when there is no description, no place, nobody? Where do we go to find our peace of mind? . . .</p><p>The fact is, staving off our own death is one of our favorite national pastimes. Whether it&#x2019;s exercise, checking our choles�terol or having a mammogram, we are always hedging against mortality. Find out what the profile is, and identify the ways in which you do not fit it. But a sniper taking a single clean shot, not into a crowd but through the sight, reminds us horribly of death itself. Despite our best intentions, it is still, for the most part, random.</p><p>And it is absolutely coming.</p><p>Patchett and Becker expose the common ways we seek to deny the rumble of panic. This book is an effort to do what they urge&#x2014;�to take life seriously. I want to help readers live life well and even joyfully against the background of these terrible realities. The loss of loved ones, debil�itating and fatal illnesses, personal betrayals, financial reversals, and moral failures&#x2014;�all of these will eventually come upon you if you live out a normal life span. No one is immune.</p><p>Therefore, no matter what precautions we take, no matter how well we have put together a good life, no matter how hard we have worked to be healthy, wealthy, comfortable with friends and family, and success�ful with our career&#x2014;�something will inevitably ruin it. No amount of money, power, and planning can prevent bereavement, dire illness, rela�tionship betrayal, financial disaster, or a host of other troubles from entering your life. Human life is fatally fragile and subject to forces be�yond our power to manage. Life is tragic.</p><p>We all know this intuitively, and those who face the challenge of suf�fering and pain learn all too well that it is impossible to do so using only our own resources. We all need support if we are not to succumb to despair. In this book we will argue that inevitably this support must be spiritual.</p><p><b>&#x201c;Let the Afflicted Hear and Be Glad&#x201d;</b></p><p>On our wedding day, Kathy and I spoke our vows to each other in front of our friends and families. To the traditional words of commitment we added a passage of Scripture&#x2014;�Psalm 34:1&#x2013;�3&#x2014;�which is engraved on the inside of our wedding rings.</p><p>I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.</p><p>My soul makes its boast in the Lord; let the afflicted hear and be glad.</p><p>O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together!</p><p>Saying our vows was a heady moment, and the lofty words of the text enhanced it. We were embarking on a lifetime of Christian ministry to�gether, and we anticipated boldly presenting the God we knew to the world. At the time, however, we almost completely ignored the words at the center of the passage. The text&#x2019;s definition of ministry success is that &#x201c;the afflicted hear and be glad.&#x201d; One of the reasons that phrase was lost on us then was because, as Kathy said later, &#x201c;at that age neither of us had suffered so much as an ingrown toenail.&#x201d; We were young, and the hubris of youth does not imagine pain and suffering. Little did we un�derstand how crucial it would be to help people understand and face affliction, and to face it well ourselves.</p><p>As I took up life as a minister, I tried to understand why so many people resisted and rejected God. I soon realized that perhaps the main reason was affliction and suffering. How could a good God, a just God, a loving God, allow such misery, depravity, pain, and anguish? Doubts in the mind can grow along with pain in the heart. When I sat with sufferers, I often found myself fielding white-�hot objections to God&#x2019;s existence and to Christian faith. Some years ago, a Hollywood actress was interviewed after her lover had died suddenly in an accident. She had been living without thought or reference to God for a long time, but once this happened she said, &#x201c;How could a loving God let this hap�pen?&#x201d; In an instant she went from indifference to God to anger toward him. It is this kind of experience that has led a host of thinkers to argue, as the writer Stendhal (Marie-�Henri Beyle) did, that &#x201c;the only excuse for God is that he doesn&#x2019;t exist.&#x201d;</p><p>But at the same time, I learned that just as many people <i>find </i>God through affliction and suffering. They find that adversity moves them toward God rather than away. Troubled times awaken them out of their haunted sleep of spiritual self-�sufficiency into a serious search for the divine. Suffering &#x201c;plants the flag of truth within the fortress of a rebel soul.&#x201d; It is an exaggeration to say that no one finds God unless suffering comes into their lives&#x2014;�but it is not a big one. When pain and suffering come upon us, we finally see not only that we are not in control of our lives but that we never were.</p><p>Over the years, I also came to realize that adversity did not merely lead people to believe in God&#x2019;s existence. It pulled those who already believed into a deeper experience of God&#x2019;s reality, love, and grace. One of the main ways we move from abstract knowledge about God to a personal encounter with him as a living reality is through the furnace of affliction. As C. S. Lewis famously put it, &#x201c;God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain.&#x201d; Believers understand many doctrinal truths in the mind, but those truths seldom make the journey down into the heart except through disappointment, failure, and loss. As a man who seemed about to lose both his career and his family once said to me, &#x201c;I always knew, in principle, that &#x2018;Jesus is all you need&#x2019; to get through. But you don&#x2019;t really know Jesus is all you need until Jesus is all you have.&#x201d;</p><p>Finally, as I grew in my understanding of the Bible itself, I came to see that the reality of suffering was one of its main themes. The book of Genesis begins with an account of how evil and death came into the world. The book of Exodus recounts Israel&#x2019;s forty years in the wilder�ness, a time of intense testing and trial. The wisdom literature of the Old Testament is largely dedicated to the problem of suffering. The book of Psalms provides a prayer for every possible situation in life, and so it is striking how filled it is with cries of pain and with blunt questions to God about the seeming randomness and injustice of suffering. In Psalm 44, the writer looks at the devastation of his country and calls, &#x201c;Awake, O Lord! Why do you sleep? . . . . ?Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?&#x201d; (Ps 44:23&#x2013;�24) The books of Job and Ec�clesiastes are almost wholly dedicated to deep reflection on unjust suf�fering and on the frustrating pointlessness that characterizes so much of life. The prophets Jeremiah and Habakkuk give searing expression to the human complaint that evil seems to rule history. New Testament books such as Hebrews and 1 Peter are almost entirely devoted to helping people face relentless sorrows and troubles. And towering over all, the central figure of the whole of Scripture, Jesus Christ, is a man of sor�rows. The Bible, therefore, is about suffering as much as it is about anything.</p><p>Inevitably, Kathy and I found ourselves facing our own griefs. In 2002, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and went through surgery and treatment. Around the same time, Kathy&#x2019;s Crohn&#x2019;s disease became acute and she had to undergo numerous surgeries over the next few years, once enduring seven in one year. At one point, I found myself facing the agonizing possibility that I should leave the pastoral ministry because of my wife&#x2019;s chronic illness. It was the darkest time of our lives so far. And we know for certain, from Scripture and experience, that there are more dark times to come. And yet also more joy than we can now imagine.</p><p>Looking back on our lives, Kathy and I came to realize that at the heart of why people disbelieve <i>and</i> believe in God, of why people de�cline <i>and</i> grow in character, of how God becomes less real <i>and </i>more real to us&#x2014;�is suffering. And when we looked to the Bible to understand this deep pattern, we came to see that the great theme of the Bible itself is how God brings fullness of joy not just despite but <i>through</i> suffering, just as Jesus saved us not in spite of but <i>because</i> of what he endured on the cross. And so there is a peculiar, rich, and poignant joy that seems to come to us only through and in suffering.</p><p>What we have learned from these years of ministry to &#x201c;the afflicted&#x201d; is in this volume. Simone Weil writes that suffering makes God &#x201c;appear to be absent.&#x201d; She is right. But in Psalm 34, David counters that though God feels absent, it does not mean he actually is. Looking back at a time when his life had been in grave danger and all seemed lost, David con�cludes, &#x201c;The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit&#x201d; (v. 18).</p><p>I&#x2019;m writing this book because we have found in our own lives that this is true.</p><p><b>The Fiery Furnace and the Plan for This Book</b></p><p>So is this a book for sufferers? Yes, but we must make some distinctions. We are all sufferers, or we will be. But not all of us are currently in an experience of deep pain and grief. Those who are not feeling it, but are seeing it in others, will have a host of philosophical, social, psychologi�cal, and moral questions about it. On the other hand, those who are in the grip of pain and difficulty <i>now </i>cannot treat it as a philosophical issue. Speaking to the questions of the nonsufferer as well as to the struggles of the sufferer in one book is a not a simple task. While the afflicted person may cry out using philosophical questions&#x2014;�&#x201c;Why do you allow such things, God?&#x201d;&#x2014;�the real concern is personal survival. How can you survive it? How can you get through it without losing the best parts of yourself? To speak in a detached philosophical manner to an actual suf�ferer is cruel. And yet the experience of pain leads almost inevitably to &#x201c;big questions&#x201d; about God and the nature of things that cannot be ig�nored.</p><p>As I read books on evil and suffering, it became clear that most vol�umes treated the subject mainly from just one perspective. Many books used the philosophical perspective, weighing the &#x201c;problem of evil&#x201d; and whether it made the existence of God more or less likely or Christianity more or less plausible. Others took a theological approach, distilling and assembling all the biblical themes and teachings about pain and suffer�ing. Finally, many books took a devotional approach, writing a series of meditations designed to help actual sufferers in the midst of their grief. There was also a smaller number of articles and books that took both a historical and an anthropological approach, examining how different cultures have helped its members face troubles and trials. The more I read, the clearer it became that these various perspectives informed one another, and that any treatment that confined itself to only one vantage point left far too many unanswered questions.</p><p>And so I have divided the book into three parts, each part looking at the issue using somewhat different tools. What unites them is the central image of suffering as a fiery furnace. This biblical metaphor is a rich one. Fire is, of course, a well-�known image for torment and pain. The Bible calls trials and troubles &#x201c;walking through fire&#x201d; (Isa 43:2) or a &#x201c;fiery ordeal&#x201d; (1 Pet 4:12). But it also likens suffering to a fiery <i>furnace </i>(1 Pet 1:6&#x2013;�7). The biblical understanding of a furnace is more what we would call a &#x201c;forge.&#x201d; Anything with that degree of heat is, of course, a very dangerous and powerful thing. However, if used properly, it does not destroy. Things put into the furnace properly can be shaped, refined, purified, and even beautified. This is a remarkable view of suffering, that if faced and endured with faith, it can in the end only make us better, stronger, and more filled with greatness and joy. Suffering, then, actually can use evil against itself. It can thwart the destructive purposes of e...</p></p><h2>The Letters of Virginia Woolf: Volume 6 : 1936-1941</h2><p>A collection of Virginia Woolf's correspondence from age six to the eve of her marriage twenty-four years later.

Through their ministry---and after losing a young son to cancer---the Wessells have learned to ask very difficult questions about life, love, health, suffering, tragedy, and God. In his work with the comatose, Wessells has found that the voiceless have some crucial, direct, and clarifying things to tell us about our questions. Often during his life on earth, Jesus avoided giving answers and instead offered love. The voiceless ones---the poor, the suffering, infants, prisoners, and the terminally ill---speak for God. Their words to us, like Christ&#39;s, are often impractical, inconvenient, and unpredictable. Yet above all, they are a relief. This book is about asking the unanswerable questions and letting them draw you closer to your Lord and Savior.</p><p>John Wessells and his wife, Gail, are co-founders of Precious Oil Ministries, an outreach to head-injury patients and their families. John is a musician and has been involved in various forms of worship ministry for more than twenty years. He and Gail live in Otego, New York, and have three children, Daniele, Rachel, and David.Starred Review. Wessells spends his days praying and singing worship songs for head trauma patients in comas, something he admits may seem frivolous. He makes the case that these people and their families are among "the least of these" for whom Jesus cares deeply. And his stories are powerful. He talks about a young man who made a decision to follow Christ while in a comatose state. He tells of sharing his faith with Christine Busalacchi before her father got permission to remove her feeding tube and she starved to death&#x2014;how the girl neurologists described as being "in a persistent vegetative state" had waved to him, smiled and responded to praise music. But more importantly, Wessells discusses the difficult questions that a ministry like his uncovers. Why are some lives cut short? Why do some patients recover, while others' bodies shrivel as their minds slowly lose control? Wessells reassures readers that it's okay to ask questions and not have answers&#x2014;and that, no matter what, God's love abounds. These are lessons he learned not only through his ministry but also through the loss of his young son to cancer. This is a rare book that offers hope and comfort without ignoring or sugarcoating the painful realities that families of head trauma patients face. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Developed with input from survivor advocates in Maine, New York, and Maryland, and with the support of the Departments of Mental Health in the states of Maine and New York, this self-help toolkit is both comprehensive and flexible. This versatile workbook can be used as an independent self-help program, in the context of individual therapy, or in a group setting. It teaches trauma survivors to recognize, contextualize, and understand distressing dissociative and posttraumatic reactions. It also creates a structure in which to learn and practice skills for self-regulation of the troublesome thoughts, feelings, and impulses related to traumatic experiences. Rather than simply offering &#34;band aid&#34;-type crisis intervention, this self-paced program empowers survivors with an understanding of where the symptoms come from and why. By learning a variety of interventions, skills, and techniques, survivors are able to select and make use of different &#34;tools&#34; for different self-regulation purposes.</p><p>Growing Beyond Survival was developed in part and extensively field tested at Trauma Disorders Programs at Sheppard Pratt Hospital in Baltimore. The author, Elizabeth Vermilyea, led symptom management groups at Sheppard Pratt for several years. She currently provides training for Sidran Institute on topics related to traumatic stress."Elizabeth Vermilyea offers trauma survivors a wealth of practical coping strategies in the context of a clinically sound rationale. Growing Beyond Survival integrates concrete techniques for regulating emotions into a systematic approach for enhancing self-awareness. The book's encouraging and supportive tone gives survivors much-needed permission to engage in self-care. Trauma therapists also will find the book a useful resource from which they can glean many tips for helping their clients with self-regulation." --Jon G. Allen, Ph.D., Helen Malsin Palley Chair in Mental Health Research, The Menninger Clinic Immediate Past Editor, Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic<br><br>"I plan to use Growing Beyond Survival in conjunction with my own therapy. My therapist has also reviewed the book and said it would be an excellent companion in our work together. Although some of these skills are not new to me, I have only seen or heard of them piecemeal.

The idealism of the cause&#x2014;defending democracy from fascism at a time when Europe was darkening toward another world war&#x2014;and the brutality of the conflict drew from them some of their best work: <i>Guernica</i>, <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>, <i>Homage to Catalonia, The Spanish Earth</i>.<br> <br>The war spurred breakthroughs in military and medical technology as well. New aircraft, new weapons, new tactics and strategy all emerged in the intense Spanish conflict. Indiscriminate destruction raining from the sky became a dreaded reality for the first time. Progress also arose from the horror: the doctors and nurses who volunteered to serve with the Spanish defenders devised major advances in battlefield surgery and front-line blood transfusion. In those ways, and in many others, the Spanish Civil War served as a test bed for World War II, and for the entire twentieth century. <br> <br>From the life of John James Audubon to the invention of the atomic bomb, readers have long relied on Richard Rhodes to explain, distill, and dramatize crucial moments in history. Now, he takes us into battlefields and bomb shelters, into the studios of artists, into the crowded wards of war hospitals, and into the hearts and minds of a rich cast of characters to show how the ideological, aesthetic, and technological developments that emerged in Spain changed the world forever.</p><p>Richard Rhodes is the author of numerous books and the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award.

Many are American and European athletes enrolled for the anti-fascist People&#x2019;s Olympiad, canceled now, meant to be an alternative to the official Olympics about to open in Nazi Berlin. They crowd the deck of an overburdened Spanish boat hired to evacuate them, pressing at the dockside railing for a last look. Above the harbor the high pedestaled statue of Christopher Columbus, its gilding gone like Spanish power, points them west to the New World, but the promenade of the Ramblas behind it that follows an old streambed up into the heart of the city is strewn with shattered trees, dead horses, burned cars. Bullets have pockmarked the fa�ades of churches; blood dries on barricades of paving stones. The city has been pacified and crowds sing, but fascist snipers still hammer death from rooftops and empty windows.<br> <br>A young American woman at the railing, Muriel Rukeyser, poet leaving to tell the world, locates her Bavarian lover on the crowded pier&#x2014;<br> <br>At the end of July, exile. We watch the gangplank go.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>They met on the tourist train coming down from Paris, the tall, voluptuous woman and the tall, lean man, a runner, an exiled anti-Nazi. They wasted no time. Three days and nights of lovemaking with no common language on the hot train halted by the general strike outside the battling city and then he released her, joined the International Column&#x2014;<br> <br>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;first of the faces going home into war<br> <br>the brave man Otto Boch, the German exile&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>he kept his life straight as a single issue&#x2014;<br> <br>left at that dock we left, his gazing Brueghel face,<br> <br>square forehead and eyes, strong square breast fading,<br> <br>the narrow runner&#x2019;s hips diminishing dark.<br> <br>An English journal had commissioned her to cover the People&#x2019;s Olympiad, a last-minute substitute for an editor who had begged off to attend a wedding. She had departed London for Spain that late July unaware that the shooting had already begun. From mid-June to mid-July more than sixty people had been assassinated in Spain and ten churches set on fire; a spate of bombings had shaken the country. In that season she would remember as the &#x201c;hot, beautiful summer of 1936&#x201d; she was twenty-two, with dark, thick hair and gray eyes, intensely intelligent, already a prizewinning poet. It was her first time out of America.<br> <br>Muriel Rukeyser was an early eyewitness to Spain&#x2019;s civil war. Those germinal days would change her; the war would be a touchstone of her poetry for the rest of her life. The war of Spanish democracy against its fascist generals and landed rich and their North African mercenaries would change the lives of everyone it touched. Enlarging to a &#x201c;little world war&#x201d;&#x2014;Time magazine&#x2019;s coinage&#x2014;it would serve as a test bed for new technologies both of life and of death.<br> <br>In London the porter at Victoria Station had spoken to Rukeyser of European war. She found Paris bannered with &#x201c;posters and notices of gas-masks.&#x201d; There she had boarded the metal-green night express to little Cerb�re in its Mediterranean cove, the last stop in France, where a fan of rail yard behind the town narrowed to cross the border through a tunnel and fanned out again behind Spain&#x2019;s Port Bou.<br> <br>The different gauges of the two countries&#x2019; tracks required a change of trains. While Rukeyser and her fellow passengers transferred on the shuttle train that Sunday, the forty-three-year-old traitor Francisco Franco Bahamonde, once the youngest general in the Spanish army, approached his country from the Atlantic side. Since March Franco had been idling in rustic exile in the Canary Islands, a thousand miles from Madrid, expelled there by the Republic to limit his influence. Now the London correspondent of a Spanish royalist newspaper was spiriting him in a chartered twin-engine Dragon Rapide to Tetuan, in North Africa opposite Gibraltar, where Spain&#x2019;s faithless Army of Africa awaited him. The generals&#x2019; rebellion on the mainland needed reinforcements for its coup to succeed; the Spanish people, taking up arms, were already putting down rebel uprisings in cities all over Spain.<br> <br>After Rukeyser passed through customs in Port Bou there was time for a swim. The train on the Spanish side was slow, local, and hot, Olympic teams and Spanish and foreign passengers stifling now on benches in wooden third-class cars. Beyond the train windows the terrain turned mountainous, the earth red-gold.<br> <br>&#x201c;The train stops at every little station,&#x201d; Rukeyser notices, &#x201c;rests, moves as if exhausted when it does move.&#x201d; Two Spanish soldiers pass through the car in black patent-leather hats and &#x201c;comic-opera uniforms with natty yellow leather straps,&#x201d; smoking English cigarettes and pointing out olive orchards, castles, and churches. &#x201c;There is time to point out any amount of landscape,&#x201d; Rukeyser notes drily. At the stations the soldiers stick their guns out the windows, saluting the armed workers patrolling the platforms.<br> <br>Nearer Barcelona the signs of fighting increase, militiamen with rifles guarding road intersections along the way. At one station a miliciana, a girl in a simple cotton dress leading a troop of boys with guns, works through the train. The determined girl searches bags and luggage for photographs, fotograf�as, confiscating them, pulling film from cameras. A panicked American woman tells Rukeyser the girl and the armed boys must be communists bent on stealing, but a calmer Spanish passenger says the &#x201c;fascists&#x201d;&#x2014;Franco&#x2019;s nationalists&#x2014;have been killing any armed civilians they identify from photographs. The young people handle the cameras carefully and return them to their owners intact.<br> <br>Around midday that Sunday the train halts in Montcada, a small town seven miles above Barcelona: the beleaguered government in Madrid has called a general strike. How long they would be stuck there no one knew. They would not have wanted to continue into the Catalan capital yet; the uprising was still raging. The New York Times&#x2019;s Barcelona correspondent, Lawrence Fernsworth, described hearing &#x201c;continuous volleys of rifle fire&#x201d; in the city that bloody Sunday, &#x201c;clattering hoofs and bugle calls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. men shouting and others screaming in anguish&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. screeching flocks of swallows flying back and forth in a frenzy as bullets whistle among them.&#x201d; Fernsworth saw &#x201c;riderless horses [that] galloped over the bodies of the dead and the dying. From windows and rooftops everywhere spat more rifle and machine-gun fire. Motorcars overfilled with armed men raced through the streets.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Fieldpieces, now in the hands of the populace, boomed from street intersections. Their shells tore through the length of the streets, slicing off trees, exploding against a building or blowing a stalled streetcar or an automobile to bits.&#x201d;<br> <br>By Monday evening the republic&#x2019;s militias had gained control and Fernsworth found only &#x201c;splotches of blood drying on the pavement where the wounded had been taken away&#x201d; in the Plaza Catalu�a, the city center at the head of the long, tree-lined walk of the Ramblas. &#x201c;Empty cartridges and bandoliers were lying about everywhere.&#x201d; With bloodshed and more broken walls and Dolores Ib�rruri, the woman they called La Pasionaria, on the radio crying &#x201c;No pasaran! [They shall not pass!]&#x201d; Madrid had been secured as well.<br> <br>The Spanish people were fighting alone. Even the government they had elected, a coalition just six months old, was riven with dissent. In the past decade they had endured a rump monarchy and then a right-wing dictatorship. In 1934 the coal miners in the northern mining district of Asturias had revolted. Franco, hastily appointed army chief of staff, had been called in to put down the revolt and had done so brutally with mercenaries from Spanish Morocco, the people the Spanish called Moros. The Moroccans were enthusiastic and inventive killers: castrating the wounded was a favorite sport, robbing the dead a recreation.<br> <br>When Spain voted for democracy in February 1936 the new leaders had banished Franco to his post in the Canaries. From that exile he had plotted with his fellow generals to stage a coup d&#x2019;�tat. Moors had first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in A.D. 711 and it had taken the Spanish seven hundred years to drive them out. Ferdinand and Isabella had completed that reconquista and Columbus had sailed in the banner year 1492. Now the rebel generals were rallying the Moors&#x2019; descendants in the name of Christian Spain to overthrow the legitimate Spanish government and hack their way to power. &#x201c;Glory to the heroic Army of Africa,&#x201d; Franco radioed the mainland army and navy bases in late July 1936, floridly, when he had secured North Africa at the beginning of the coup. &#x201c;Spain above everything! Accept the enthusiastic greetings of those garrisons which join you and all other comrades in the Peninsula in these historic moments. Blind faith in victory! Long live Spain with honor!&#x201d;<br> <br>It was urgent that Franco move the Moroccan mercenaries and Spanish Foreign Legionaries who supported the rebel generals to the Peninsula&#x2014;to mainland Spain&#x2014;or the nationalist coup d&#x2019;�tat would fail. But ordinary seamen in the Spanish navy rejected the rebellion. When their nationalist officers resisted, the seamen killed them. In those first days of conflict the chemist Jos� Giral, for a few brief weeks the prime minister of republican Spain&#x2014;it was he who had dissolved the army and ordered the people armed when the coup began on 19 July&#x2014;sent the navy to blockade Morocco and quarantine the colonial rebellion in North Africa.<br> <br>The rebels&#x2019; few gunboats were no match for the Spanish navy&#x2014;no match, for that matter, for even the antiquated Spanish air force, which could strafe and bomb the nationalist transports. To move his forces to the Peninsula, Franco realized, he needed aircraft. A mission he sent to Italian prime minister and fascist Duce Benito Mussolini in Rome collided with one sent there from Navarre by Franco&#x2019;s fellow rebel general Emilio Mola, confusing Mussolini about who was in charge. The nationalists&#x2019; leader at the outset had been sixty-four-year-old senior general Jos� Sanjurjo, styled &#x201c;the Lion of the Rif&#x201d; for his victories in the coastal Rif region of northern Morocco, but with a trunkful of uniforms he had overloaded the little Puss Moth biplane sent to fetch him from Lisbon and it had crashed on takeoff and burned. Mola now commanded in the north, operating independently, and Franco in the south. Mussolini hesitated.<br> <br>Franco had better luck in Germany. His first message went out through diplomatic channels on 22 July, asking for ten transport aircraft, payment to be deferred. The German foreign ministry saw no benefit in supporting the rebellion and denied the request within twenty-four hours. Fortunately for Franco, Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s Germany had a dual-track government. Franco&#x2019;s second appeal passed through Nazi Party channels directly to Hitler&#x2019;s deputy Rudolf Hess, who alerted the F�hrer. The two expatriate German businessmen who carried Franco&#x2019;s appeal from Morocco to Berlin in a commandeered Lufthansa Junkers-52 traveled on with Hess to Bayreuth, where Hitler was attending the annual Wagner festival.<br> <br>Fresh from a performance of Die Walk�re, &#x201c;The Ride of the Valkyries&#x201d; slow-rolling in his head, Hitler met Franco&#x2019;s delegates in the Wagner villa at ten thirty on the evening of 25 July 1936. They had not had their dinner. The F�hrer asked a few skeptical questions. The rebels had no money? &#x201c;You cannot begin a war like that.&#x201d; Without help, Franco would lose? &#x201c;He is lost.&#x201d; But he warmed to the challenge and lectured Franco&#x2019;s delegates undined for the next three hours. He called in his war and air ministers, Werner von Blomberg and Hermann Goering. Goering misread the F�hrer&#x2019;s mood and objected to supporting the rebels&#x2014;the Luftwaffe itself, he complained, only recently emerged from its Lufthansa camouflage, was short of planes&#x2014;until he realized that Hitler had made up his mind. Then Goering discovered his enthusiasm for the Spanish project. At his Nuremberg trial the air marshal claimed he urged Hitler &#x201c;to give support under all circumstances, firstly, in order to prevent the further spread of communism in that theater and, secondly, to test my young Luftwaffe at this opportunity in this or that technical respect.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hitler had different motives. He paid lip service to keeping the Strait of Gibraltar free of communist control&#x2014;to the Nazis, Spain&#x2019;s Popular Front coalition was communist&#x2014;but in fact he wanted to distract England and France from German rearmament with a challenge to France&#x2019;s rear and Britain&#x2019;s access to the Suez Canal. To fuel rearmament he wanted Spanish iron ore, mercury, and especially pyrites, the cubic crystals of fool&#x2019;s gold&#x2014;iron and copper sulfide&#x2014;that yielded iron, copper, lead, zinc, and sulfuric acid for industrial processing. Spain, a country rich in metals, had mountains of pyrites to trade. Franco had asked for ten transports. Grandly, Hitler decided to send him twenty trimotor Junkers-52s that could be converted into bombers, with crews and maintenance personnel and six fighter escorts. With a nod to Wagner, he christened the operation Feuerzauber&#x2014;Magic Fire&#x2014;and went to bed contented; for the F�hrer, wizarding the fate of whole populations was all in a night&#x2019;s work.<br> <br>The Spanish republican forces needed aircraft as well. Giral had telegraphed L�on Blum, the socialist French prime minister, on 20 July, asking for bombs and bombers, but the French right wing howled. Blum in London on 23 July heard, he said later, &#x201c;counsels of prudence&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dispensed and sharp fears expressed.&#x201d; English prime minister Stanley Baldwin put it bluntly enough. &#x201c;We hate Fascism,&#x201d; he is supposed to have said. &#x201c;But we hate Bolshevism just as much. If, therefore, there is a country where Fascists and Bolsheviks kill each other, it is a boon for mankind.&#x201d; Under pressure from the English, who favored Franco, Blum decided that nonintervention was the better part of valor.<br> <br>The French were not opposed to private sales, however. The air ministry dispatched thirty-four-year-old Andr� Malraux, the novelist and cultural buccaneer, to Madrid on 23 July to assess republican requirements. Briefed about the vicissitudes of the Spanish air force, most of whose officers however had remained loyal, Malraux toured the Madrid area and met with the Spanish president, Manuel Aza�a. In an optimistic dispatch to the Paris newspaper L&#x2019;Humanit� he reported, &#x201c;Madrid has been completely cleared as far south as Andaluc�a, to the east as far as the sea, to the west as far as Portugal. It is only in the north that the rebel army has sent out small advance guards, which have been beaten and pushed back beyond the hillsides of the Sierra de Guadarrama&#x201d;&#x2014;the mountain range that barricaded Madrid to the northwest. Back in Paris Malraux began buying planes and recruiting pilots. Both were dear, the planes antiquated, most of the pilots mercenaries prepared to engage the fascists in aerial dogfights for a monthly 25,000 francs in combat pay (about $35,000 today).<br> <br>Mussolini, having sorted out who among the rebels was in charge, wanted cash for his ...</p><h2>The Orvis Fly Patterns Index</h2><p>A collection of Orvis patterns for tying artificial flies for all types of fish includes tying hints for complex patterns and discusses hooks and materials</p><p></p><h2>Runaway Ralph</h2><p>Fed up with his family, Ralph decides to hop on his motorcycle and head down the road to Happy Acres Camp.

Ships well-packaged and protected.</p><p>What makes the Harry Potter series so successful? Maybe it's the fact that J.K. Rowling doesn't write children's books, she writes children's stories, more in the tradition of the Brothers Grimm than Dr. Seuss. The exploits of Harry and his friends captivate even the shortest attention spans by engaging the imagination with vivid characters and fast-moving action, instead of trying to merely catch the eye with colorful pictures or pop-up effects. Not surprisingly, the Potter tales sound wonderful read aloud, and adapt to the audiobook format extremely well. Broadway actor Jim Dale's impressive vocal range gives each character in the book its own distinctive voice--a considerable task, given the pantheon of witches, warlocks, ghosts, ghouls, dwarves, and elves that Harry encounters in his second outing. And thankfully, since the book is read unabridged, no one's favorite character is omitted. Engaging for children without being childish, the audio version of <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> is worthy addition to the deservedly popular series. (Running time: 9 hours, 7 CDs) <i>--Andrew Nieland</i>The Dursleys were so mean that hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. <br>And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny. <br>But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself?</p><h2>Aborting America</h2><p>A prominent obstetrician/gynecologist who led the fight for the repeal of abortion laws, Nathanson explains how his views on abortion have changed and why he now supports a Constitutional amendment on the right to life</p><p></p><h2>All for the Newborn Baby</h2><p>Mary sings a lullaby to the newborn baby Jesus as He lies in the manger, and in her song she describes how the world around Him is rejoicing at His birth.</p><p>Ages 2-5. This delicately illustrated lullaby imagines what Mary might have sung to Jesus in the manger. Each page, addressed to the newborn, describes how an abundant world of animals and plants celebrates the child's birth: "Cherry tree / With branches bending / Offers cherries / Ripe and red. / Spider spins / A silken blanket, / Lays it on your / Manger bed." The addition of a musical score would have been a nice touch, but parents will likely come up with their own tune for this elegant, rhyming song that's expanded in glittering, detailed illustrations reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts. Gold borders filled with botanical ornaments frame soft, colorful nature scenes depicting joyous creatures mingling with the loving family. Although the author cites Christmas miracle tales as her inspiration, her soothing poem never mentions Jesus by name, emphasizing instead the love and astonishment that a new mother feels for her child. Young ones from diverse backgrounds will find themselves celebrated in this universal, joyful song. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Born in Chicago, he attended Northwestern University and upon graduation went to work for the Associated Press, beginning a lifelong career in journalism that would include long periods at the&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Advertising Age</i>.<br> While at the&nbsp;<i>Tribune</i>, Goldsborough began writing mysteries in the voice of Rex Stout, the creator of iconic sleuths Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. Goldsborough&#x2019;s first novel starring Wolfe,&nbsp;<i>Murder in E Minor</i>&nbsp;(1986), was met with acclaim from both critics and devoted fans, winning a Nero Award from the Wolfe Pack. Nine more Wolfe mysteries followed, including&nbsp;<i>Death on Deadline&nbsp;</i>(1987) and&nbsp;<i>Fade to Black</i>&nbsp;(1990). <i>Stop the Presses!</i>&nbsp;(2016) is his most recent novel. &nbsp;When not satisfying his gourmet palate, Super Sleuth Nero Wolfe is solving a case of murder in the Silver Spire, a Staten Island ministry. This whodunit is not one of twists and turns of plot, but one of good, well-rounded characters. For the most part, reader Michael Murphy gives a good performance. Initially, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish among characters&#39; voices. Some good jazz is interjected at the chapter breaks. Despite minor flaws, this is an enjoyable performance of a good mystery. G.A.D.

Now, in The One-Life Solution, he turns his attention to what for many Americans is one of the most difficult problems they face: in an era of ceaseless communication, when jobs don&#39;t stop when you leave the office, and ever-increasing complexity, how can readers integrate life and work so as to achieve happiness and success at both? With the straightforward tools Dr. Cloud provides, even the most harried professional torn between demanding bosses, coworkers, and clients and the pressures of family and personal life will be able to implement The One-Life Solution to find success and happiness.</p><p><p>Do you feel that if you could get rid of some of the chaos in your work life, you could take your performance to a greater level? Do you stay late at the office many nights, trying to empty an inbox that never seems to diminish? Do you have difficulty dealing with cantankerous bosses or passive-aggressive coworkers? Do you find yourself checking your BlackBerry&#x2014;almost against your will&#x2014;during dates, family dinners, or your children's soccer games? If you've answered yes to any of the above, chances are you feel fragmented, pulled in too many directions at once, frustrated. Your work life has taken over your personal life.</p><p>In <em>The One-Life Solution</em>, Dr. Henry Cloud, consultant, bestselling author of the <em>Boundaries</em> series and <em>Integrity</em>, and clinical psychologist, examines the workplace. He demonstrates how our failure to maintain a unified life with good boundaries at the office not only blurs the line between the professional and the personal, but leaves us less equipped to deal with the problems of today's workplace: stress, heavy workload, and a blistering pace. As a result, we are overworked, overstressed, and unhappier than ever. Through real-world examples from years of working with leaders at companies large and small, Dr. Cloud shows us how to construct and enforce better boundaries against the technological devices, bullying bosses, and distracting coworkers who invade our time and space.</p><p>From conducting an audit of your time, to developing a policy of who you are and what you stand for, to learning how to overcome a paralyzing inability to say no, Dr. Cloud provides invaluable strategies and scripts for moving toward a more unified, coherent sense of self and a life that fully encompasses work, family, and spirituality. In a clear, conversational voice, he will help you develop the ability to:</p><ul><p></p><li>contain self-destructive behavior and keep it from spreading.</li><p></p><p></p><li>define yourself and know who you are.</li><p></p><p></p><li>set limits when needed.</li><p></p><p></p><li>communicate effectively.</li><p></p><p></p><li>learn how to improve your performance at the office and outside it.</li><p></p></ul><p>By starting to do what's best for you, you'll find the key to living the one happy, fulfilling life that only you can live.</p>Dr. Henry Cloud is a popular speaker, and co-host, with Dr. John Townsend, of the nationally broadcast New Life Live!

It has been a legend for over forty years. Early in 1997 General Motors unveiled the fifth-generation Corvette. All Corvettes Are Red is the inside story of the people who made that Corvette, from drawing board to assembly line.<br>The gap between the fourth- and fifth-generation Corvettes (C4 and C5, in GM lingo) was the longest ever, and the Corvette program came close to dying. Just as serious design work was under way, GM suffered the worst losses in its corporate history, and the C5 program was put on hold. The Corvette was saved by a fiercely dedicated team of designers, engineers, and executives, who pulled together to keep their dream car alive. They overcame internal politics and company-wide budget cuts to produce a new Corvette that is better engineered, better built, and less expensive than its predecessors.<br>Author James Schefter was granted unprecedented access to every part of GM, including areas that were off-limits to many company vice presidents. He spent eight years witnessing the C5's journey from drawing board to clay model to prototype to production vehicle. He accompanied test drivers across scorching deserts and into snow-packed mountains. As a result All Corvettes Are Red is not just the most authoritative book ever written about the Corvette, it is the most revealing account of the inner workings of the U.S. automobile industry.</p><p>Another fly-on-the-wall peek at General Motors (after Michael Shnayerson's The Car That Could, p. 956), this time from a former West Coast editor for Popular Science. Schefter is allowed to prowl around the hallways of GM, focusing on the design and launching of the 1997 Corvette. Schefter begins with the image of a Hindenburg-esque GM in 1992, fighting a staggering loss of $10 billion. In desperation, the carmaker turned to its classy jewel, the Corvette, to solve its financial woes. Released in 1953, the Corvette hadn't had a redesign since 1984, and an underground lair called ``The Corvette Skunk Works'' had been intermittently working to update the car since 1988. Faced with company-wide losses, the Corvette project was buried and unearthed again by a succession of GM honchos, until at last the new car was set to be launched in 1995. Schefter specializes in minutiae: He gives a compelling description of how artists painstakingly carve out models from 800-pound blocks of clay, and he elegantly describes how the project's engineers solved a gas-tank design problem. The entire corporate world of GM takes on elements of the archetypal Old West: There's the Corvette itself, seen as a beautiful and reliable show horse; executives who pledge their word with a handshake; and heroes who are taciturn but proud of their teams, prone to pronouncements like ``If we lose the summer of '95, we lose the program.'' While the elevation of the business book to drama is increasingly common, Schefter seems to have a little fun with it, though he tends to relentlessly cheerlead for GM. (And it looks like they missed '95 after all: The book will be released on the same day as the newly redesigned Corvette.) Overly dramatic but always readable, it's the attention to insider details that make this account interesting for Corvette enthusiasts and pedestrians alike. (8 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) (Radio satellite tour) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The Corvette is America's best-loved and longest-lived sports car. For this work, Schefter was granted unprecedented access to board meetings, designers' studios, and engineers' workshops to document the conception and development of the 1997 Corvette, newly redesigned for only the fourth time in the car's 40-year history. A revealing tale of intrigue and the inner workings of corporate America is the result. Had the book (and the car) been released in 1993 as originally planned, this work might have been unique. However, so far in 1996 "insider" books on GM's electric car (Michael Schnayerson, The Car That Could: The Inside Story of GM's Revolutionary Vehicle, LJ 8/96) and Chrysler's redesigned minivans (Brock Yates, The Critical Path, LJ 7/96) have already focused on the development and/or redesign of important vehicles to the extent that little is left for Schefter to say on the subject of "new and different." On the other hand, this is a book about the Corvette, an American legend and icon. The car has a following, and one expects that the book will have a following as well.?Eric C. Shoaf, Brown Univ.

And sure, on one level, it's the conventional tale of a disparate dugout population cohering over the course of a season and marching ineluctably toward the World Series. But convention, like a 55-foot curveball, ends there and then scoots off in its own unpredictable direction. Harris's story--funny, bittersweet, and affecting--is, in the end, a haunting meditation on life, death, friendship, and loyalty. That it's set against the backdrop of the Major Leagues makes it a baseball novel. That it's a brilliant study of human nature, passionately felt and beautifully crafted, makes it enduring literature. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Biblical Counseling Movement: History and Context</h2><p>Beginning in the late 1960s, a biblical counseling movement sought to reclaim counseling for the church and provide a Christian alternative to mainstream psychiatry and psychotherapy. The <i>Biblical Counseling Movement: History and Context</i> is an informative and thought-provoking account of that movement. This historical account combines careful scholarship with a unique, eyewitness insight. This book is an invaluable resource for those who want to understand the biblical counseling movement. The core chapters were originally a Ph.D. dissertation in history of science and medicine (University of Pennsylvania). This new edition adds a lengthy appendix, containing articles by Dr. Powlison that give an analysis of developments within the biblical counseling movement and in its relationship to evangelical psychotherapists.</p><p><p>David Powlison, MDiv, PhD, (1949&#x2013;2019) was a teacher, counselor, and the executive director of the Christian Counseling &amp; Educational Foundation (CCEF).

The counseling wars of the past half-century have ignited passions often characterized by labels rather than by careful analytic thought. This is the first broadly comprehensive history of these developments. While trying to be open to truth and insight whatever their source, Powlison faithfully argues that the Christian faith must play a constitutive role in building a robust model of Christian counseling.

Here he explains how, in its decision to invade Iraq, the Bush administration failed in its stewardship of American foreign policy. First, the administration wrongly made preventive war the central tenet of its foreign policy. In addition, it badly misjudged the global reaction to its exercise of benevolent hegemony.&#x201d; And finally, it failed to appreciate the difficulties involved in large-scale social engineering, grossly underestimating the difficulties involved in establishing a successful democratic government in Iraq.<br>Fukuyama explores the contention by the Bush administration&#x2019;s critics that it had a neoconservative agenda that dictated its foreign policy during the president&#x2019;s first term.&nbsp; Providing a fascinating history of the varied strands of neoconservative thought since the 1930s, Fukuyama argues that the movement&#x2019;s legacy is a complex one that can be&nbsp; interpreted quite differently than it was after the end of the Cold War. Analyzing the Bush administration&#x2019;s miscalculations in responding to the post September 11 challenge, Fukuyama proposes a new approach to American foreign policy through which such mistakes might be turned around one in which the positive aspects of the neoconservative legacy are joined with a more realistic view of the way American power can be used around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A Conversation with Frank Fukuyama<br>&nbsp;<br>Q:&nbsp; You have called <i>America at the Crossroads</i> your most personal book to date. Why is that?<br>A:&nbsp; I have ties to almost all of the important strands of the neoconservative movement I&#x2019;ve known Paul Wolfowitz since college and worked for him on two occasions, as well as with his mentor Albert Wohlstetter; I was a student of the Straussian political theorist Allan Bloom; and I have been a long-time contributor to neoconservative journals like <i>Commentary</i> and <i>The Public Interest.</i> The fact that I didn&#x2019;t like the Iraq war from the start has made me wonder, who was wrong, me or my friends?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q:&nbsp; What, exactly, are your criticisms of the Bush administration in regard to the Iraq war?<br>A:&nbsp; Three things principally. First, an overestimation of the threat from radical Islamism that drove us to take the risk of preventive war in Iraq. Second, a belief that we could exert benevolent hegemony&#x201d; over the world in a way that would make non-Americans grateful. And finally, a belief that the United States could undertake an incredibly ambitious plan to politically transform the Middle East in a way that completely contradicted everything neocons said about the limits of social engineering.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q:&nbsp; What principles, then, should guide American foreign policy in a new political reality marked by globalization and American hegemony?<br>A:&nbsp; The neocons are absolutely right that in a globalized world full of failed states and terrorists with access to WMD, we have to pay attention to what goes on inside other countries and have strategies to promote democracy and good governance in them. But preemptive war cannot be the primary means of doing this: it is soft rather than hard power that is most effective. And the United States has to come up with new forms of international organization, beyond the United Nations, to promote legitimate and effective cooperation.<br><br><b>Francis Fukuyama</b> is Bernard L.

This acknowledged classic contains 365 daily readings that take heady doctrine and make it practical, realistic, and intensely personal. With humor and humility, Chambers speaks plainly to the common man struggling with devotion to Christ in daily living. Worldly cares and self-serving desires begin to lose their appeal as Chambers aides the reader in transforming his mind by viewing life through the instruction of God's Word. Richard Halverson, former chaplain of the United States Senate, attests to this: "no book except the Bible has influenced my walk with Christ at such deep maturing levels." This is Chambers's chief desire, directing the reader to "shut out every other consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only--My Utmost for His Highest... determined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone." <i>--Jill Heatherly</i><p>It&#x2019;s one of the best-loved devotionals of all time. . .and now it&#x2019;s back in Barbour&#x2019;s special promotional edition!

B. Hill, grandson of Napoleon Hill</i></p><p>Words of wisdom, age-old adages, myths and folktales&#x2014;whatever we call them, the stories we tell one another and pass down to the next generation connect us across race, religion, and national boundaries. Although these stories have diverse themes, each is powered by the testimony of example, and no story resonates so universally as the tale of how to succeed in life.</p><p>But what does this mean? For most of us, it is the application of the experience of others to our own lives. Samuel Smiles, a Scottish author, wrote the first book about success in 1859. Appropriately titled <i>Self Help</i>, it laid the framework for the writings of Orison Swett Marden, and later Napoleon Hill, by teaching success through the parables of experience. Napoleon Hill, who is arguably the founder of the modern-day success movement, was a master storyteller who compiled the first comprehensive philosophy of success. He did this after discovering that the most remarkable self-made men of his time&#x2014;like Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, and Henry Ford&#x2014;all did the same thing to succeed, although they each used different means.</p><p>For the past 150 years, success philosophers and thinkers have proved time and again that one trait in particular appears to be a key to all great achievement&#x2014;<i>persistence</i>. It was persistence that allowed George Goethals to build the Panama Canal when so many had failed. It was persistence that drove Edison to success in devising a viable lightbulb. It was persistence that pushed Abraham Lincoln through a broken heart, two business failures, and eight losses for election to public office to become president of the United States. Napoleon Hill wrote:</p><p>One reason why most men seldom accumulate fortunes until they have passed well beyond the 40-year goal post of life is that <i>they must undergo</i> failures and adversities and overcome sufficient obstacles to develop in them sufficient knowledge to accumulate wealth.</p><p>Therefore, it is those who persist and learn from failure who carve their place in history.</p><p>As I read <i>Stickability</i>, I was reminded of a boy I knew more than fifty years ago named Scott Shaw. He was my playmate during early adolescence and was perhaps the most obnoxious kid in the world. One day, our jostling turned into a knock-down fight. There was no one around to cheer us on or to stop the fight. So we fought as boys do, until we didn&#x2019;t fight anymore. I was bigger and stronger than he was and I kept knocking him down. But every time Scott went down, he got up and came at me.</p><p>With bloody lip, tears flowing from his eyes, and snot dripping from his nose, he kept getting off the ground and coming at me. He took everything I dished out, and still he came at me, time after time. After he got off the ground for the last time, he was met with my hand, offering him a handshake. Mastered, I said, &#x201c;You win, Scott&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you win.&#x201d; He glared at me, wiped his nose, stifled a tear, and shook my hand. We were friends until I moved away a few years later.</p><p><i>Stickability</i> is full of stories about people like Scott Shaw&#x2014;men and women who refused to submit to defeat. It is a delightful book, written with the same energy, impact, and simplicity as <i>Outwitting the Devil</i> and <i>Think and Grow Rich: Three Feet from Gold</i>. This new Napoleon Hill Foundation book shares insight from the people who have helped shape our world. They are the leaders who began a pathway to success with nothing more than an idea to follow. Their goals may not be your goals, and their setbacks and failures are not yours either. However, their stories are parables of success that will inspire you to find <i>your</i> own road to personal achievement.</p><p><i>Stickability</i> reinforces the proven success principles that were compiled by my grandfather, Napoleon Hill, during his lifetime by providing valuable, thought-provoking insight from the lives of incredible people. Their stories demonstrate that a definite goal strengthened by persistence will always lead to success. They show that &#x201c;negatives&#x201d; are just the tasks that need to be done to avoid a setback and that setbacks should be viewed as <i>opportunities </i>to reroute a path to success.</p><p>This is the book to pick off a shelf and read and reread during those discouraging moments when the temptation to quit looms larger than the desire for success. It is a book that clearly explains why Napoleon Hill wrote, &#x201c;Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step BEYOND their greatest setback and failure.&#x201d;</p><p>So when the time comes to refocus, redirect, and recommit (as it surely will), take a copy off the shelf, put your feet up for an hour or so, and read <i>Stickability</i> again. It is a small price for success.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>The Three Causes of Failure</p><p>You&#x2019;ve seen those infomercials. The ones that make elaborate claims like:</p><p>&#x201c;You too can make money in real estate and be a mogul like me! Buy our 30-day course and we&#x2019;ll make you an instant millionaire.&#x201d;</p><p>Maybe you&#x2019;ve even bought a book that promised to change your life overnight, or attended a seminar to learn the latest investment tips to become financially independent <i>in no time</i>.</p><p>Both late-night TV and local bookstores are filled with the latest and greatest &#x201c;get rich&#x201d; opportunities that are guaranteed to succeed. Each novel idea is larger than the next. Whether it&#x2019;s stocks, bonds, real estate, or what have you, the solution is always the same: Follow these simple, easy steps and watch your bank account grow with little effort.</p><p>Thus, happiness is achieved.</p><p>The leaps from get-rich-quick to success to happiness are there, although they are implied, for the most part. They are nestled in between the lines of stories that have little relevance to <i>your</i> power&#x2014;which is the power to define what it is you want.</p><p>Get-rich-quick narratives distract us from this. We are then left only to adopt someone else&#x2019;s goal and perhaps quit halfway to achieving it. Obstacles are only as insurmountable as your goal&#x2014;your <i>want</i>&#x2014;is weak.</p><p>Unfortunately, these narratives rarely tell us that success is seldom easy<i>.</i> The fact is that we will have to face challenges and obstacles in order to achieve most goals. They forget to mention that unexpected circumstances are inevitable, and more important that how we accept, deny, or capitalize on these circumstances is entirely up to us&#x2014;and will ultimately determine our success or failure.</p><p>Every individual who has attained personal achievement can tell you that the question is not <i>will</i> there be tough times, the question is <i>when</i> will they arrive? It&#x2019;s through these moments of uncertainty that our character is revealed.</p><p>For many, the first sign of difficulties can be enough for them to become discouraged and stop doing what they intended, while others find the determination to discover another way to prevail. Rather than giving up, they look for the opportunity <i>within</i> the challenge&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s there, always. Some opportunities are buried deep within the challenge. Others are easy to find. The extent to which we&#x2019;re able to slow down, breathe, and adopt perspective is the extent to which we&#x2019;re able to find the opportunity within the challenge. We&#x2019;re then in a much better position to overcome any challenge and achieve whatever it is we want to achieve.</p><p>Make no mistake&#x2014;adopting perspective in the face of challenge is not easy. This in itself is the challenge.</p><p>We can agree that we all want happiness and prosperity in our lives, and also know that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p><i>Happiness takes discipline.</i></p><p>To achieve happiness we must first have the discipline to determine carefully what this means for us. Once we have a clearly defined goal, we must maintain discipline to find the opportunities within the challenges we&#x2019;ll face along the way. This is when we make strides in what we call <i>self-development</i>.</p><p>Think about it. It&#x2019;s easy to be happy-go-lucky and make great decisions when everything is going our way. The question is, how do we respond when a challenge comes? It&#x2019;s at this precise moment that who we are as people is revealed to the world, and to us. When we quit, we automatically <i>fail</i>&#x2014;meaning simply that we do not achieve a goal. Yet, when we accept the challenge, we&#x2019;re able to clearly understand the reason(s) for the challenge, find the opportunity, and continue on a different path.</p><p>How we handle temporary setbacks will ultimately determine our outcome.</p><p>Remember this: whether it&#x2019;s a weed in the garden, a dream, desire&#x2014;or even fear&#x2014;what we feed and focus attention on will eventually grow the most. The same applies to opportunity. What we focus on is what we see. When one seeks the good, good things happen. When one seeks opportunity, opportunities occur.</p><p>When it comes to financial matters, for example, you may fixate on media buzz or a temporary dip in the market, get anxious, and veer from your long-term intention by selling your interest. Alternatively, someone else may see a golden opportunity to take advantage of the dip and buy more at a lower rate.</p><p>The realities are the same for us all. Yes, the market may be the lowest in years, yet where one person sees only loss and challenge, another sees opportunity and possibility.</p><p>Just the fact that you are reading this shows you are smart enough to know that somewhere along life&#x2019;s journey, a wrench will be thrown into the gears. It also shows that you are intelligent enough to know right from wrong.</p><p>When hurdles arise, will you cut corners or stay the course? Will you fudge the numbers or keep what&#x2019;s true? You can see someone&#x2019;s true self simply by observing how they act when they&#x2019;re faced with a difficult situation and think no one is watching.</p><p>And someone is <i>always</i> watching, even when we&#x2019;re not aware of it.</p><p>Moral philosopher and political economist Adam Smith introduced the concept of the <i>impartial spectator</i> to help us understand this phenomenon. The impartial spectator refers to the general notion that we all have of what is commonly expected of us. In this sense, society&#x2019;s expectations act as a body of surveillance that affects our actions and thoughts. When we are faced with challenges, our reactions expose our true character to others specifically, and to the impartial spectator generally. This is why it is crucial to know clearly who we are and who we want to be. Seizing opportunities within challenges exposes a character of strength, resolve, patience and, yes, <i>stickability</i>.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s look at <i>success</i> from a different perspective and turn the principle upside down. Rather than focus on and illustrate another surefire blueprint for abundance, as mentioned earlier, let&#x2019;s place our attention on its counterpart: <i>failure</i>, and its often forgotten component, <i>missed opportunity.</i></p><p>It&#x2019;s been suggested that personal achievement eventually comes from focusing on our <i>major definite purpose</i> (some call it passion) and then from the courage and <i>stickability</i> to see that vision through.</p><p>Those of us who are familiar with this concept from Napoleon Hill may be surprised to find that he also had brilliant insights into <i>failure</i> and <i>challenges</i> that have gone relatively unnoticed in subsequent decades.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s take a look back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>In 1938, one year after releasing what many refer to as the bible of personal development, <i>Think and Grow Rich</i>, Dr. Hill was interviewed on a syndicated radio program. He examined the topic of failure from a unique perspective that has gone unpublished until today.</p><p>The following excerpts reveal in his own words what he referred to as the Three Causes of Failure<i>.</i></p><p>In an unwavering discussion, Hill explained how three habits can either ruin a person&#x2019;s dreams or be redirected and transformed into stepping-stones for success.</p><p>When asked what the causes of failure are, Hill answered:</p><p>&#x201c;Cause of failure number one is <i>the inability to get along with other people.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Regardless of how well educated you may be, or how responsible your job may be, or how much money you may have, if you can&#x2019;t induce people to like you, if you can&#x2019;t get along with all sorts of people under all sorts of circumstances, you can never become a great success in any undertaking.&#x201d;</p><p>Hill was asked, &#x201c;What can you do to make people like you?&#x201d;</p><p>He explained, &#x201c;The first step you must take in causing people to like you is by liking them, and expressing it in the tone of your voice, in a pleasant smile when you are speaking to others, and in a sincere desire to be helpful to others whether they deserve it or not.&#x201d;</p><p>This first cause of failure may seem simple to avoid, yet it is an art to really learn to love people and become loveable. The more you work on developing your personality, the easier you&#x2019;ll interact with those around you.</p><p>Think about it this way: the best way to get others interested in you is to show interest in them. Consider this. If folks take an interest in a story you tell at a party, you are far more likely to show interest in their stories, right? The same applies to others as applies to you.</p><p>You are not alone.</p><p>According to what&#x2019;s known as the Gaia Principle, the earth is a living, breathing organism. The theory posits that each and every component of this organism&#x2014;including humans&#x2014;is connected to every other component for survival. In spite of the relatively recent explosion of <i>individualism</i>, we must reestablish the fundamental value of working with others. It is a skill, to be sure. You were not born with or without the necessary skills to get along with others. These skills are learned. We must continuously hone what&#x2019;s known today as <i>people skills</i> to succeed in any area of life.</p><p>&#x201c;It is impossible to be successful on your own,&#x201d; Hill declared. &#x201c;The better you get along with others and are able to induce them to work with you, the more you&#x2019;ll be able to achieve. You can&#x2019;t be quick to judge, overly critical, or look down on people.&#x201d;</p><p>Continuing, Hill explained:</p><p>&#x201c;The second cause of failure is a very common one, the habit of <i>quitting</i> when the going is hard. No matter who you are or how skilled you may be in your occupation, there will be times when the going is hard, and unpleasant circumstances will overtake you. Now, if you yield easily to these obstacles you may as well write yourself off as far as becoming a great success is concerned. When you meet with opposition of any nature, instead of quitting, you should turn on more willpower; kill the fires with stronger faith in your own ability while making up your mind that you will not sell yourself short, and eventually you will succeed.&#x201d;</p><p>It bears repeating: do not sell yourself short!</p><p>You deserve everything you seek. <i>Know</i> this, and you are well on your way. But being <i>on the way</i> to success is clearly not enough. How many times have we quit too soon? Often there is just one more step needed, but we fail to see this because we are too preoccupied with the challenge itself&#x2014;and not the solution.</p><p></p></p><h2>How the Amazon Queen Fought the Prince of Egypt</h2><p>Serpot, ruler of a land where women live free, without men, leads her Amazon warriors in battle against Prince Pedikhons of Egypt, who has come to see for himself if women can equal men, even in battle.</p><p><b>Tamara Bower</b> has been creating art all her life, encouraged by her mother, an artist. Ms. Bower first became interested in ancient Egypt at age ten, checking out every book on the subject in her school library.<p>She learned archaeological illustration at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and later drew pictures for the Egyptian Department of the Brooklyn Museum of Art. She has assisted many scholars and worked on-site at excavations in Egypt, Turkey, Spain, and California. Her first book was <i>The Shipwrecked Sailor,</i> published by Atheneum in 2000.</p><p>Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Ms. Bower now lives with her cat, Tennessee, in New York City.</p>Grade 3-6&#x2013;This exceedingly handsome book tells of the famous women warriors besieged by an Egyptian and Assyrian army. Their queen uses both craft (her sister infiltrates the camp) and valor against the enemy, and personally goes head-to-head with the prince. Their daylong combat begins with insults but ends with a declaration of love that, after sweaty hours of lethal opposition, must be based on character rather than beauty. Bower takes the tale from a Hellenistic scroll, adding a few details. (Since the figures are all posed in archaic profile/frontal combination, the question of the sacrificed breast doesn't arise; in any case, the queen fights with spear and shield, not bow.) Budding Egyptologists and archaeologists will be enthralled by the hieroglyphs on endpapers and many pages. There are splendid frescolike panels; other spreads provide a drawing, text, and hieroglyph version of that portion of the text printed in bold. The deceptively simple-looking outline drawings will encourage imitation, though Bower's elegant spareness and lapis/sienna colors will be hard to equal. Five pages of information (including map and book list) at the end explain the source and the system of hieroglyphic writing. Hours of educational pleasure are pretty much guaranteed.<i>&#x2013;Patricia D. Lothrop, St. George's School, Newport, RI</i></p><h2>Michael Jackson&#39;s Great Beers of Belgium</h2><p>NEW 5th fully revised and expanded edition, over 300 new photographs, 501 pages. English edition, published in Antwerp, Belgium by Media Marketing Communications (MMC). This is the latest edition of the world famous book by Michael Jackson devoted entirely to the fabulous beers of Belgium. Includes many beautiful color pictures. Some of the incredible beers discussed are fruit beers, white beers, lambics, saisons, trappist beers, and monk&#39;s beers. Also included is a chapter on bed and beer which describes brewery visits, beer cuisine, and nearby sleeping accommodations.</p><p>Belgium must be Michael Jackson's idea of heaven. The diversity, individuality, and ubiquity of beer in that country astounds even the beer sophisticate. Belgians lay claim to dozens of brewing styles that, motley as they are, read like a royal registry of beer: Lambics, Abbey Ales, Belgian Whites, Strong Golden Ales, Trappist Ales, Belgian Browns. Consider the Lambic brewer's "wind through the rafters" approach, in which wild yeast and airborne bacteria are responsible for the fermentation process and the otherworldly flavor characteristics of the final product. The brewing style is so dependent on the microflora of the greater Brussels area that it cannot be successfully duplicated anywhere else in the world.<p> Jackson exposes the history and inner workings of this quiet, quirky brewing behemoth with characteristic thoroughness and enthusiasm. We learn the origins of monastic brewing, the good fortune of spiders in Lambic breweries, and the reasoning behind using orange peels, coriander seeds, and three years' worth of stale hops in the brewing process. Ample tasting notes of commercial Belgian products--from those famous worldwide to those available only locally--provide a reference point for the reader's own beer hunting.</p><p> A few bottles of Belgian brew and a copy of <i>Great Beers of Belgium</i> are as close to a brewing tour of Belgium one can get, short of visiting the country itself. Such armchair exploration, with Jackson as a guide, may be just the revelation that makes a physical trip irresistible. <i>--Todd Gehman</i></p>Michael Jackson is the frequently awarded writer of books on beer, whiskey and travels.

For those of us with printer's block, there's a terrific section on developing a design-getting visual ideas from casual doodles, nature tracings, photographs, and found objects. Then come the materials, tools, and techniques--making eraser prints, carving a linoleum block, making a woodcut, even building block out of polymer clay. And, because designs are even more fun on objects than framed on the wall, all of the prints appear on functional things: wrapping paper and note cards, book covers, a calendar, a poster, a T-shirt, even a lampshade. Relief prints have a classic, almost folk art look that is universally appealing. With this informative introduction, crafters and beginning artists alike can create handsome designs and well-decorated objects.<br></p><p></p><h2>Wilt, 1962: The Night of 100 Points and the Dawn of a New Era</h2><p>On the night of March 2, 1962, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, right up the street from the chocolate factory, Wilt Chamberlain, a young and striking athlete celebrated as the Big Dipper, scored one hundred points in a game against the New York Knickerbockers.<br><br>As historic and revolutionary as the achievement was, it remains shrouded in myth. The game was not televised; no New York sportswriters showed up; and a fourteen-year-old local boy ran onto the court when Chamberlain scored his hundredth point, shook his hand, and then ran off with the basketball. In telling the story of this remarkable night, author Gary M. Pomerantz brings to life a lost world of American sports.<br><br>In 1962, the National Basketball Association, stepchild to the college game, was searching for its identity. Its teams were mostly white, the number of black players limited by an unspoken quota. Games were played in drafty, half-filled arenas, and the players traveled on buses and trains, telling tall tales, playing cards, and sometimes reading Joyce. Into this scene stepped the unprecedented Wilt Chamberlain: strong and quick-witted, voluble and enigmatic, a seven-footer who played with a colossal will and a dancer&#x2019;s grace. That strength, will, grace, and mystery were never more in focus than on March 2, 1962. Pomerantz tracked down Knicks and Philadelphia Warriors, fans, journalists, team officials, other NBA stars of the era, and basketball historians, conducting more than 250 interviews in all, to recreate in painstaking detail the game that announced the Dipper&#x2019;s greatness. He brings us to Hershey, Pennsylvania, a sweet-seeming model of the gentle, homogeneous small-town America that was fast becoming anachronistic. We see the fans and players, alternately fascinated and confused by Wilt, drawn anxiously into the spectacle. Pomerantz portrays the other legendary figures in this story: the Warriors&#x2019; elegant coach Frank McGuire; the beloved, if rumpled, team owner Eddie Gottlieb; and the irreverent p.a. announcer Dave &#x201c;the Zink&#x201d; Zinkoff, who handed out free salamis courtside.<br><br>At the heart of the book is the self-made Chamberlain, a romantic cosmopolitan who owned a nightclub in Harlem and shrugged off segregation with a bebop cool but harbored every slight deep in his psyche. March 2, 1962, presented the awesome sight of Wilt Chamberlain imposing himself on a world that would diminish him. <i>Wilt, 1962</i> is not only the dramatic story of a singular basketball game but a meditation on small towns, midcentury America, and one of the most intriguing figures in the pantheon of sports heroes. <br><br>Also available as a Random House AudioBook</p><p>Gary M. Pomerantz earned acclaim with his two previous books. <i>Where Peachtree Meets Sweet Auburn</i>, a multigenerational biography of Atlanta and its racial conscience, was named a 1996 Notable Book of the Year by the <i>New York Times</i>. <i>Nine Minutes, Twenty Seconds</i> (2001), the true story of an airplane crash, has been published in Britain, Germany, and China. A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, Pomerantz worked for nearly two decades as a journalist, first as a sportswriter for the <i>Washington Post </i>and then writing columns, editorials, and special projects for the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>. He later served for two years as Distinguished Visiting Professor of Journalism at Emory University in Atlanta. He lives today in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife and their three children.<b>Chapter 1: The Dipper in Harlem</b><br><br>There is a photograph of the Dipper with James Baldwin on a Harlem street corner, the big man in a slim suit and snap-brim fedora, tilting his frame toward the writer, seemingly half his size. If not classically handsome, Chamberlain&#x2019;s face was arresting: a long, narrow brow over almond eyes lit by youth and restless ambition, high cheekbones, and a cool jazzman&#x2019;s trimmed mustache. Then, when he really wanted something (or someone), there came a starry smile and his deep baritone transformed to the smooth, soft patter of the FM radio deejay. It was Baldwin who in 1961, back in America after years of self-imposed exile in Europe, wrote words that defined his life&#x2019;s direction, words that Chamberlain may have heard. Baldwin wrote, &#x201c;I had said that I was going to be a writer, God, Satan, and Mississippi notwithstanding, and that color did not matter, and that I was going to be free. And, here I was, left with only myself to deal with. It was entirely up to me.&#x201d;<br><br>Chamberlain, too, would create himself, would refuse to be defined by size or color or his sport. In 1962, the Dipper drove a white Cadillac convertible, but only until he could take delivery of a nobleman&#x2019;s car, a Bentley, custom-made in England at a cost of nearly $30,000 (including tax and shipping), roughly six times the average yearly salary for an American worker. Wealthy after his one season with the Globetrotters and three with the Warriors, he used his big money as a tool of self-creation. After buying his parents a house in west Philadelphia, he lavished upon himself twenty fine suits, thirteen pairs of stylish shoes, the Cadillac, and a chic, pricey, Oriental-motif apartment on Central Park West. It was a far cry from 401 Salford Street, where Chamberlain had been raised. With nine children, William and Olivia Chamberlain, a handyman and a domestic, at times had two, three, or four kids in each bedroom; at five-thirty each morning they felt the trolleys rumble past their rented row house in ethnic, working-class west Philly.<br><br>The young Dipper came of age noticing little discrimination, though once, when he was about four, on a bus in Virginia bound for Philadelphia, his mother wouldn&#x2019;t allow him to sit near the front. &#x201c;No, mama, this seat right here is open,&#x201d; the young Dipper protested, even as she tried to steer him toward the rear of the segregated bus. It prompted the white bus driver to intervene, &#x201c;No, sonny, you go back there with your mother like a good little boy,&#x201d; and he did, though uncertain as to why.<br><br>So valuable was Chamberlain&#x2019;s name now, so incandescent his persona, that a historic Harlem nightclub, Smalls Paradise, let him buy in as part-owner and put his name first on the marquee in exchange for his presence. He loved Harlem, the neon, the ladies, James Brown, Etta James, Redd Foxx, a lush life with jazz the soundtrack. And when Wilton Norman Chamberlain moved through Big Wilt&#x2019;s Smalls Paradise, there attached to him an aura suggesting he owned not only this place, but all of Harlem, perhaps all of New York. His presence in the club was signaled by the white Cadillac parked out front by one of the nightclub boys on the corner of 135th Street, while Chamberlain strode around the club&#x2019;s dark interior greeting his guests, draping an arm around Tom &#x201c;Satch&#x201d; Sanders of the Boston Celtics, squeezing a shoulder, &#x201c;Good to see you, Satch. Sit down, relax, and enjoy yourself.&#x201d; Reminiscing years later, the Dipper would recall this as the greatest time in his life.<br><br>At Big Wilt&#x2019;s Smalls Paradise, the bandleader King Curtis worked deep into the night, and the denizens turned up wearing sharkskin suits and memorable monikers: Big Pete, Little Pete, an intellectual straight shooter known as Knowledge, and of course, Charlie Polk, Wilt&#x2019;s right-hand man, always at his side, Robin to his Batman. His name, called out so often, rolled off the Dipper&#x2019;s tongue: Chollypolk. Small and thin as straw, Polk was, as one Harlem nightclub regular would say, &#x201c;one of those types of guys who if he latched on to you, he didn&#x2019;t let go.&#x201d; Whatever the Dipper wanted&#x2014;his shirts picked up at the cleaners, his friend&#x2019;s wife picked up at the bus stop and taken shopping&#x2014;Chollypolk got it done. When a beautiful woman at Smalls caught the Dipper&#x2019;s eye, Chollypolk became his emissary, quietly letting the woman know of his boss&#x2019;s interest and gauging her availability. He loved being on stage at the club, and though he couldn&#x2019;t sing or dance and he stuttered slightly, he was a riotous emcee. If you put a microphone in his hand, Chollypolk might never let go of it, and Redd Foxx would sit beside the stage, waiting, waiting to begin his gig.<br><br>Foxx, a bawdy redheaded comic, was a Harlem favorite. &#x201c;Lincoln got his head on all the pennies. Roosevelt got his head on all the dimes,&#x201d; Foxx would say. &#x201c;I just want to get my hands on some.&#x201d; In his first New York nightclub date in a decade, Foxx, a rising national star (to all but the censors), appeared at Smalls Paradise in December 1961. In smoky clubs, perspiring beneath the spotlight, Foxx would deliver his raunchy routines, unafraid of the social taboos of sex and race. In one, using his trademark off-color double entendres, he told of how everyone in his hometown had bought a jackass. &#x201c;Even the little bitty kids, they had a ass of their own,&#x201d; Foxx would say. &#x201c;Preacher&#x2019;s wife had the biggest ass in town. I know because I rode her big ass all the time.&#x201d; And, Foxx said, her husband, the preacher, &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t have such a bad ass himself,&#x201d; though when a fire broke out in the church&#x2019;s back pew, &#x201c;Reverend took a long running jump out the window to land on his ass. But somebody had stolen Ol&#x2019; Reverend&#x2019;s ass and he wasn&#x2019;t there. Reverend fell down into a deep hole in the ground and that&#x2019;s where they found him.&#x201d; Foxx gave a comic&#x2019;s pause. &#x201c;Just goes to show you, don&#x2019;t it? Some folks don&#x2019;t know their ass from a hole in the ground.&#x201d;<br><br>Smalls Paradise was a legend that dated back to the Harlem Renaissance of the Twenties when its waiters danced or roller-skated across the room with service trays held high; the club was known then as the Hottest Spot in Harlem. Chamberlain had long wanted his own nightclub, an environment that had always drawn him as a stage for his fabulousness&#x2014;why, even when he was just sixteen, his rival at West Philadelphia High, Ray Scott, had spotted him at a dance at the O.V. Catto Elks Lodge in Philadelphia and noticed how the Dipper flourished in such a setting, managing what all of the other boys couldn&#x2019;t, a laid-back, Miles Davis, be-bop cool. Chamberlain well knew the precedents of black athletes owning such places in New York. Back in the Twenties, Club Deluxe in Harlem briefly was owned by the prizefighter Jack Johnson, a controversial figure excoriated by the white press in the early part of the century for having twice married white women and later imprisoned for transporting a woman across state lines in violation of the Mann Act. Now Joe Louis and Ray Robinson lent their names and money to The Brown Bomber and Sugar Ray&#x2019;s. It wasn&#x2019;t so much the fast life that attracted the Dipper to buy a piece of Smalls in the spring of 1961. He rarely drank or smoked and he exercised every day, pushing his own physical limits. (Before one weekend trip to Atlantic City, his friend Cal Ramsey tried to pick up Chamberlain&#x2019;s suitcase but found it too heavy. Ramsey looked inside and discovered why&#x2014;the Dipper&#x2019;s barbells.) What attracted Chamberlain to Smalls Paradise was the chance to explore new avenues of his own celebrity.<br><br>In calm moments, the Abyssinian Baptist Church crowd came for early Sunday dinners. But on most other nights, the nightclub was, like its part owner, full of the energy and exuberance of youth. &#x201c;The Twist&#x201d; by Philadelphia&#x2019;s Chubby Checker was yet the rage, and the Tuesday night Twist contests packed the downstairs Wilmac Room. Limousines and taxis carrying big-money whites triple-parked out front. &#x201c;Meeting again at Smalls Paradise as their fathers did before them, a brand new generation of monied fun-seeking whites is flocking happily to Harlem,&#x201d; <i>Ebony</i> magazine noted. &#x201c;And Wilt Chamberlain&#x2019;s cash registers are running as hot as the gyrations on the floor.&#x201d; It was a see-and-be-seen crowd, sophisticated, elite, and integrated. Smiling for pictures for <i> Ebony</i> magazine on a Tuesday Twist night were comic Jack Carter, famed saxophonist Cannonball Adderly with actress Olga James, a Rockefeller, an Astor, Edward Smalls (the former owner who sold the club in 1955), the Greek ambassador to the United Nations, singer Lloyd Price, and of course, the Dipper himself.<br><br>His nightclub impressed other African-American players in the NBA, not only for its high style and glitz but because it suggested Chamberlain&#x2019;s business acumen. They considered Big Wilt&#x2019;s Smalls Paradise a must-stop along the Strip in Harlem along with Jocks and the Red Rooster. The Knicks&#x2019; Willie Naulls and Johnny Green were regulars at Smalls. The Celtics&#x2019; K.C. Jones, in with Bill Russell once, met James Brown, and was overwhelmed by the magnitude of the Godfather of Soul&#x2019;s ego.<br><br>Here, in Harlem, was the Wilt Chamberlain few white Americans knew: easing comfortably through what W.E.B. Du Bois once had called &#x201c;the Black World Beyond the Veil.&#x201d; Here was the Apollo Theater and Showman&#x2019;s Lounge, the Big Apple bar, The Harlem Moon, Lickity Split, and Roy Campanella&#x2019;s liquor store.

A formerly patented design for author James Kachadorian&#39;s Solar Slab heat exchanger is now available for the use of anyone motivated by the desire to build a house that needs a backup furnace or air conditioner rarely if ever. This is a building book for the next century. Applicable to a diversity of regions, climates, budgets, and styles of architecture, Kachadorian&#39;s techniques translate the essentials of timeless solar design (siting a home in harmony with nature, using windows as solar collectors, achieving year-round comfort by balancing good insulation with healthy supplies of fresh air) into practical wisdom for today&#39;s new generation of solar builders.</p><p>I Am The Author<br> <p>It's been 3 1/2 years since THE PASSIVE SOLAR HOUSE hit the bookstores and I've been pleased with its reception. The book was written as a "gift" to the public as I realized that the design techniques I used were known only to me. The book has accomplished the goal of having readers of all disciplines read and grasp the theory and go on to design their own solar homes or hire a professional to assist them. Sometimes a little assistance is needed from me but I see the book working as intended. </p><p>It's been 25 years since I built the prototype of the system. That building served as my model home and office while I was in the business of designing and shipping solar homes in "kit" form. The building still works like a charm for its new owner. </p><p>I've lived in my solar home for 21 years. No problems as the laws of physics are hard to defy. It still amazes me how shortsighted our government's energy policies are. For the last 25 years I have purchased the small amount of fuel oil I need for the year in August when fuel oil prices are at their lowest. I've already made 50% on this year's purchase and the heat season hasn't even begun. It's a nice and secure feeling to be able to heat my home entirely with alternate fuels; or if I chose, to use my back-up oil fired system. My solar home gives me the freedom to plan my purchased energy management to use the least amount possible and obtain the lowest price. </p><p>If you decide to purchase the book, I hope you'll find it useful in designing and building your new home to utilize our finite resources in the best way possible and best of all: capturing and storing free solar heat.</p>James Kachadorian is a civil engineer with degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

According to eminent theologian J.I. Packer, however, Christians have become enchanted by modern skepticism and have joined the gigantic conspiracy of misdirection by failing to put first things first. Knowing God aims to redirect our attention to the simple, deep truth that to know God is to love His Word. What began as a number of consecutive articles angled for honest, no-nonsense readers who were fed up with facile Christian verbiage in 1973, Knowing God has become a contemporary classic by creating small studies out of great subjects. Each chapter is so specific in focus (covering topics such as the trinity, election, God&#39;s wrath, and God&#39;s sovereignty), that each succeeding chapter&#39;s theology seems to rival the next, until one&#39;s mind is so expanded that one&#39;s entire view of God has changed. Author Elizabeth Eliot wrote that amid the lofty content Packer puts the hay where the sheep can reach it--plainly shows us ordinary folks what it means to know God. Having rescued us from the individual hunches of our ultra-tolerant theological age, Packer points the reader to the true character of God with his theological competence and compassionate heart. The lazy and faint-hearted should be warned about this timeless work--God is magnified, the sinner is humbled, and the saint encouraged. --Jill Heatherly</p><p>Beautifully designed in quality bonded leather, each God&#39;s Light gift book gives God&#39;s Word on one of life&#39;s most important topics.

The setting is a sleepy Mississippi college town, where there is lots of time for tennis and gossip. The narrator, Homer, is 56, a veteran of Korea, literate and enviously well off. He spends hours at a time with his friend Jack, a cafe owner, talking, for the most part, about the debauched local rock star, Ronnie Foot. Nothing about Ronnie is good, but the worst thing he has done is take up with Jack's daughter, the schoolteacher Alice. Much of what goes on herelust, violence and eccentricityis familiar in Southern literature. There is nothing hackneyed, though, in Hannah's telling. The story and characters are brought into sharp focus by the resonant imagery. From Homer's vibrant new wife, with "hair charging blond from her head," to the black-comedy description of the Foot mansion, every word is fresh and precise. Hannah's wry voice is spellbinding. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hannah's latest novel (others include The Tennis Handsome, LJ 3/1/83) is the chronicle of a friendship that thrives amidst the lunacy and tragi-comic violence of a small Mississippi town. The narrator, Homer, is a Korean war veteran who has become a successful writer. His friend Jack is a former war correspondent, sheriff, college professor, and farmer who now runs a small cafe. Since both men have already been crazy, they can readily understand the madness of those all around them. Seeking love that can restore, Hannah's characters frequently fall prey to passions that destroy. The book contains striking proof of Hannah's verbal ingenuity, but his story is disappointingly sparse. He provides intriguing characters and anecdotes but little sustained narrative. Albert E.

Bloom&#x2019;s astonishing and astute stories illuminate the mysteries of passion, family, and friendship. A young woman is haunted by her roommate&#x2019;s murder; a man and his daughter-in-law confess their sins in the unlikeliest of places; two middle-aged, married friends find themselves surprisingly drawn to each other, risking all for their love but never underestimating the cost. Propelled by Bloom&#x2019;s dazzling prose, unmistakable voice, and generous wit, <i>Where the God of Love Hangs Out</i> takes us to the margins and the centers of people&#x2019;s emotional lives, exploring the changes that come with love and loss.</p><p><b>A Letter from Author Amy Bloom</b> <br> <p></p> <b>Short Is Good</b><br> I have loved short stories since I was a girl reading Hawthorne and Poe. Melville was a little sophisticated for me; I had to wait until I was a sulky teenager to love &#x201c;Bartleby the Scrivener,&#x201d; and then I took to walking around the house murmuring &#x201c;I would prefer not to.&#x201d; My father, a Melville admirer, begged for mercy. At the same time that I was reading the great American 19th century short story, I was also discovering my father&#x2019;s library of pre- and post-World War II wits. Dorothy Parker was not just the funny, brittle woman at the Algonquin Table; she knew sadness and self-deception from the inside out and she could put it on the page with painful, personal frankness and not a bit of self-preserving paint or pretense. Her sentences are wry, but they bleed (&#x201c;The Big Blonde&#x201d;). I read S.J. Perelman, the Jewish smart-aleck of &#x201c;Westward Ha!&#x201d; and Robert Benchley, the urbane gentleman who could keep his head and his martini, even on an ice floe. (&#x201c;Drinking makes such fools of people, and people are such fools to begin with, it&#x2019;s just compounding a felony.&#x201d;) I read odd, funny, sometimes disturbing James Thurber and used his &#x201c;In the Catbird Seat&#x201d; to plan my comeuppance of my high school principal. <p></p> The great pleasure for me in writing short stories is the fierce, elegant challenge. Writing short stories requires Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart and some help from Gregory Hines. We are the cat burglars of the business: in and out in a relatively short time, quietly dressed (not for us the grand gaudiness of 600 pages and a riff on our favorite kind of breakfast cereal) to accomplish something shocking&#x2014;and lasting&#x2014;without throwing around the furniture. <p></p> Flannery O&#x2019;Connor (a reliable source when appreciating the short story) wrote that short stories deliver &#x201c;the experience of surprise&#x201d;. The surprise, I think, is that so few pages can contain so much, that what is taken to be a prism turns out to be not only a window, but a door, as well. <p></p> If you&#x2019;re an American reader, you can love short stories the way other Americans love baseball; this is our game, people! We have more than two hundred years of know-how and knack, of creativity. Of the folksy and the hip, of traditional yarn-spinning and innovative flourishes. Of men and women, of war and loss and love, with a few ghosts and many roads not taken. And in all of that, you will find some of the funniest and most heartbreaking fiction, ever. (You could take a break right now and go find Parker&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Waltz&#x201d; and Carver&#x2019;s &#x201c;Cathedral&#x201d;.) <p></p> Short stories have no net. The writer cannot take a leisurely sixty pages to get things moving, or make a side trip onto a barely related subject, or slack off in the last forty pages. Everything is right now, right here, in the reader&#x2019;s grasp and mind&#x2019;s eye. The writer has 20 to thirty pages to entice, seduce, enter and alter the reader. For me, the short story is the depth of a novel, the breadth of a poem and, as you come to the last few paragraphs, the experience of surprise. <p></p>Amy Bloom is the author of the bestselling and acclaimed <b>Away;</b> <i>Come to Me</i>, a National Book Award finalist; <i>A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You</i>, nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award; <i>Love Invents Us</i>; and <i>Normal</i>.

It tells the story of Evangeline Knapp, the perfect, compulsive housekeeper, whose husband, Lester, is a poet and a dreamer. Suddenly, through a nearly fatal accident, their roles are reversed: Lester is confined to home in a wheelchair and his wife must work to support the family. The changes that take place between husband and wife, parents and children, are both fascinating and poignant.

A road or a line can be straight. But the human heart?<br>&#x2014;A Streetcar Named Desire</i><br><br>Since the Mississippi flows generally south from its origin in Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico, you expect a town on the river to be on the east bank or the west. But at New Orleans the river flows eastwardly, sort of, so New Orleans is on the north bank, sort of. On the other side of the river is an area known, to be sure, as West Bank, but most of it lies either south or east of the river. On a map you can see: if the river were straight, New Orleans would be almost horizontal, right to left, east to west, between the river to the south and Lake Pontchartrain (as big as Rhode Island) to the north. But the river is crooked. The best known parts of New Orleans form a sort of tipped-forward <i>S</i> along bends in the river, from Uptown and the Garden District through Downtown, the French Quarter, and on around eastward into Fauxborg Marigny and the Bywater. Within this <i>S</i>, Uptown is south (upriver) and Downtown north (downriver), because the river takes a northerly hitch. However, the part of the Quarter that is farthest downtown is referred to as the upper Quarter, though I have heard it called the lower.<br><br>So when I tell you that I am pretty damn sure that in 1998, during Hurricane Georges, I saw the river, at least the topmost layer of it, flowing backward (because the wind was blowing so hard southerly along that northerly hitch), you can see why I might not be absolutely sure.<br><br>It was late and I was by myself at the time, nobody else was around. And I was feeling let down, because although the wind was blowing hard, and half the population had been evacuated, and thousands who&#x2019;d stayed had been herded into the Superdome for their safety, and my friend Greg Jaynes and I had taken refuge in the shuttered-up Burgundy Street home of my friend Curtis Wilkie, it was clear that this was not going to be the Big One: the full force of Georges was going to miss us.<br><br>We knew this from Nash Roberts. Nash Roberts is a veteran New Orleans TV weatherman who is low-tech, at least by way of presentation, and always right. Nash was broadcasting from his own house, it looked like, tracing the hurricane with a grease pencil on a sheet of Plexiglas or a pad of paper, I forget which, while the other channels&#x2019; meteorologists were using all manner of laser pointers and rear-projected electronic schematic representations of the area. You couldn&#x2019;t tell what in the world Nash was scribbling with the grease pencil, but as usual he was the first to make the call, this one&#x2019;s going to miss us, and he was on the money.<br><br>So I felt I could venture outside and take a look at the river, and when I did, it was going backward. I&#x2019;m pretty damn sure.<br><br>Ordinarily, at any rate, when you face the river from the French Quarter you&#x2019;ll see the river flowing from your right to your left. As recently as the late sixties, early seventies, when Kermit Ruffins was a kid in New Orleans&#x2014;he&#x2019;s a fixture in the city now as a jazz musician&#x2014;he&#x2019;d catch crabs from the river, to eat. &#x201c;Get some string, tie a chicken leg on it, and when that string get real tight, pull in real slow&#x2014;scoop &#x2019;em up and put &#x2019;em in the bucket. End of the day we might have a hundred, hundred-fifty crabs.&#x201d; You wouldn&#x2019;t want to eat anything out of the river here now; it&#x2019;s filthy with silt and petrochemicals. But it&#x2019;s a robust presence. John Barry, author of <i>Rising Tide</i>, a terrific book about the horrific flood of 1927 (which the New Orleans elite managed to divert onto poorer folks&#x2019; lands) says the river is &#x201c;perfect,&#x201d; as opposed to the imperfect people who try to make it behave. It&#x2019;s a little like the horse that the New Orleans &#x201c;swamp blues&#x201d; musician Coco Robichaux told me about, which kept walking into a post, over and over. &#x201c;What are you doing trying to sell a blind horse?&#x201d; somebody said. &#x201c;He ain&#x2019;t blind,&#x201d; said the man who was trying to sell him. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just tough. He don&#x2019;t care.&#x201d;<br><br>The river is perfect because it doesn&#x2019;t care. It would just as soon drown New Orleans, or any other place, as not. But people, being imperfect, want to believe that it cares. People call it &#x201c;Old Man River,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Father of Waters.&#x201d; Big dirty thruster barreling into town.<br><br>And New Orleans, n�e <i>La Nouvelle Orleans</i>, is ready to take him on. Not &#x201c;ready&#x201d; in the sense that she has pulled herself together for their ultimate date yet (efforts are under way to figure out how to build a wall or something), but she wouldn&#x2019;t be herself if she were all squared away. Stephanie Dupuy, a native New Orleanian, once quoted Billy Wilder on Marilyn Monroe to relevant effect here. Stephanie and I were in Jennifer Flowers&#x2019;s club listening to her sing &#x201c;Happy Birthday&#x201d; in a breathy voice, and let it be said that she, who had a long affair with Bill Clinton, did not belabor the allusion by singing it explicitly to &#x201c;Mr. President.&#x201d; Stephanie works out of the mayor&#x2019;s office, coordinating with people making movies in the city. She says that when movie people come to New Orleans, they say the same thing Meyer Lansky said when he discovered Batista&#x2019;s Cuba: &#x201c;At last, a government I can work with.&#x201d; Stephanie knows Hollywood lore. She says that when people on the set of <i>Some Like It Hot </i>were complaining that Marilyn was always late, Wilder, the director, said this: &#x201c;I have an aunt in Austria who is always on time. You want her to play the part?&#x201d;<br><br>Orientation. You&#x2019;re in the French Quarter looking at the river. Now turn around and repeat this mnemonic: <i>D</i>ixie <i>C</i>ups, <i>R</i>ock &#x2019;n&#x2019; <i>B</i>owl, <i>D</i>ucks <i>B</i>y <i>R</i>uthie. The Dixie Cups were a sweet and snappy New Orleans trio, two sisters and a cousin, who knocked the Beatles off the top of the charts with &#x201c;Chapel of Love&#x201d; and had another big hit with &#x201c;Iko, Iko,&#x201d; the old Mardis Gras chant. (New Orleans has a long history of musical families, the Boswells, the Nevilles, the Marsalises, Harry Connick Jr. and Sr.&#x2014;senior having retired as the city&#x2019;s district attorney to appear as &#x201c;the singing DA.&#x201d;) Rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; Bowl is an uptown bowling alley (Mid-City Lanes) that is also where you can dance till all hours to, say, the zydeco stylings of Boozoo Chavis.

The music critic Will Friedwald praises Connie Boswell&#x2019;s singing as follows: &#x201c;Unlike [Mildred] Bailey&#x2019;s thin, delicate wisp, which, though charming, represented a coy middle-American attitude toward sex, Boswell&#x2019;s is a more directly sensual, genuinely vaginal instrument, something else [aside from the influence of Louis Armstrong] she picked up in New Orleans.&#x201d; It is said that the French founders of the city, when they couched its name in the feminine gender, as opposed to <i>Le Nouveau</i>, were making a bit of a joke: the Duke of Orleans, for whom it was named, was known to wear women&#x2019;s underwear. But if a city may be regarded as having a sex, surely Chicago for instance is male, New Orleans female. And the Quarter, for all the rectilinearity of its grid, is the most vaginal part of town.<br><br><b>Lagniappe with Orientation: Genifer Flowers</b><br><br>For a time early in the twenty-first century, she and her husband Finis D. (forgive me if I have the middle initial wrong) Shelnut operated a club in the Quarter where she sang. I had a chat with her between sets, a good-looking woman not at all stuck up. She sang pretty, too. &#x201c;It Was Just One of Those Things,&#x201d; which she modified slightly for two patrons who said they were from Buffalo (&#x201c;a trip to the moon on Buffalo wings&#x201d;), and &#x201c;You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman.&#x201d; Shelnut himself stood over in a corner listening.

A deep exploration and repudiation of Christian symbolism and morality, <i>The Antichrist</i> was the last of Nietzsche's works save for his autobiography, <i>Ecco Homo.</i> As such, it may be regarded as a final statement of some of his most important ideas.<br> &nbsp;This polemic is also one of the philosopher's most conventionally formatted books, consisting of a connected argument with few digressions and a clearly defined beginning, middle, and end. Indeed, it ranks among philosophy's most accessible and easily understood works, consisting of 62 brief chapters. Each chapter features an aphorism that advances the author's arguments against Christian tenets. Fast-paced, concise, and brimming with conviction, Nietzsche's landmark work is essential to a grasp of his complete oeuvre.</p><p>German philosopher Friedrich Wilhem Nietzsche (1844&#x2013;1900) ranks among the most influential of modern thinkers. His explorations of the motives underlying Western philosophy, religion, and morality have exercised a profound effect on generations of writers, theologians, philosophers, and psychologists. Although Nietzsche was strongly opposed to nationalism and anti-Semitism, his works were later appropriated by Fascists to support the very concepts he deplored.</p><h2>Partners In Passion: A Guide to Great Sex, Emotional Intimacy and Long-term Love</h2><p>Most of us long for intimate relationships, and though texting and emailing may keep us superficially connected, it ultimately cannot create the kind of intimacy necessary to sustain a deep, fulfilling, and lasting partnership.

A young man is murdered by the local fascists. His brother, Khristo Stoianev, is recruited into the NKVD, the Soviet secret intelligence service, and sent to Spain to serve in its civil war. Warned that he is about to become a victim of Stalin's purges, Khristo flees to Paris.

He could marry the girl he loved. Of course, things are not quite so simple. The famous Wodehouse humour, which has no equal, sees to that, in a transatlantic cocktail of breathtaking ingenuity.</p><p>Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (always known as `Plum&#39;) wrote more than ninety novels and some three hundred short stories over 73 years. He is widely recognised as the greatest 20th-century writer of humour in the English language. Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#39;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club. In 1936 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for `having made an outstanding and lasting contribution to the happiness of the world&#39;. He was made a Doctor of Letters by Oxford University in 1939 and in 1975, aged 93, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He died shortly afterwards, on St Valentine&#39;s Day.The plot of this amiable romance is secondary to its style. Wodehouse&#39;s masterful language makes high comedy out of situations that would be dull or slapstick in less capable hands. He invites reading aloud, but his effects are fragile, requiring a light, deft touch. Simon Vance&#39;s delivery is understated but satis-factory. He has a pleasant voice and a sympathetic feel for the material. But those who have heard the Bertie Wooster series from the BBC may be left wishing for a less restrained performance. J.N.

Steiner has published 12 or so remarkable books of criticism, depending on how you count them, and sundry other volumes of fiction and essays. As a senior book reviewer at the New Yorker, he did much to call attention to books that might otherwise have slipped by unnoticed. Lately, he has taken a chair in comparative literature at Oxford, the first ever. Not a bad track record, by any standard. Alas, Mr. Steiner is not satisfied, for no Steinerian school of thought has sprung from his brow. Despite undertones of self-pity and outlandish self-regard, Steiner once again offers a beautifully written and intensely stimulating book. This one is a retrospective of the main influences on and themes of his career: the relationship of high culture to cruelty in the 20th century; the superior authenticity of diaspora Judaism vis--vis Israel; the undefinable link between language and music; the sheer miracle of language itself; the modern retreat from the word; and the meaning of God for the modern mind. Steiner explores these themes anew from a biographical point of view, explaining how he came to them and what they have meant to him. Oddly, Steiner's tone is elegiac, for he thinks his work has been underrated and occasionally plagiarized. At the same time, he is proud to be an outsider to recent decades of literary criticism. Justifiably sohe really is an extraterritorial critic, belonging to the tradition of exceptional figures such as Walter Benjamin and Karl Kraus. This new book amply rewards both casual readers and specialists. Steiner's work is a tribute to a single-minded originality that has been successful against the odds. He is inimitable; a Steiner school of criticism is a contradiction in terms. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

What exactly happened, such that Jesus came to be considered God? To ask this question is to delve into a fascinating, multilayered historical puzzle - one that offers a richly illuminating look into the origins of the Western worldview and the theological underpinnings of our civilization. This fundamental historical question and its complex answer speak penetratingly to the spiritual impulses, concerns, and beliefs that have played a seminal role in our world, even as they reveal the foundation of history&#39;s most global religious movement, and fresh insights into the Western world&#39;s single most influential human being. Tackling all of these matters and more, Great Courses favorite Professor Ehrman returns with the unprecedented historical inquiry of How Jesus Became God . In 24 provocative lectures, Professor Ehrman takes you deep into the process by which the divinity of Jesus was first conceived by his followers, demonstrating how this conception was refined over time to become the core of the Christian theology. A distinguished scholar of Christianity and New York Times best-selling author, Professor Ehrman develops the inquiry with meticulous research and in-depth analysis of texts. In these lectures, Ehrman reveals that the theological understanding of Jesus as God came about through a complex series of factors and events, each of which must be understood in order to grasp this most extraordinary and historically pivotal story. In the enthralling inquiry of How Jesus Became God Professor Ehrman lays bare the diverse elements that combined to produce both an astonishing true-life story and one of history&#39;s most significant developments.

He wasn&#x2019;t allowed to sleep in his mother&#x2019;s house anymore, being fourteen years old. No self-respecting woman of Basilica would put her daughter in Rasa&#x2019;s household if a fourteen-year-old boy were in residence--especially since Nafai had started a growth spurt at the age of twelve that showed no signs of stopping even though he was already near two meters in height.<br>Only yesterday he had overheard his mother talking with her friend Dhelembuvex. &#x201c;People are beginning to speculate on when you&#x2019;re going to find an auntie for him,&#x201c; said Dhel.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s still just a boy,&#x201c; said Mother.<br>Dhel hooted with laughter. &#x201c;Rasa, my dear, are you so afraid of growing old that you can&#x2019;t admit your little baby is a man?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fear of age,&#x201c; said Mother. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s time enough for aunties and mates and all that business when he starts thinking about it himself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, he&#x2019;s <em>thinking</em>about it already,&#x201c; said Dhel. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just not talking to <em>you</em>about it.&#x201d;<br>It was true enough; it had made Nafai blush when he heard her say it, and it made him blush again when he remembered it. How did Dhel know, just to look at him for a moment that day, that his thoughts were so often on &#x201c;that business&#x201d;? But no, Dhel didn&#x2019;t know it because of anything she had seen in Nafai. She knew it because she knew men. I&#x2019;m just going through an age, thought Nafai. All boys start thinking these thoughts at about this age. Anyone can point at a male who&#x2019;s near two meters in height but still beardless and say, &#x201c;That boy is thinking about sex right now,&#x201c; and most of the time they&#x2019;ll be right.<br>But I&#x2019;m <em>not</em>like all the others, thought Nafai. I hear Mebbekew and his friends talking, and it makes me sick. I don&#x2019;t like thinking of women that crudely, sizing them up like mares to see what they&#x2019;re likely to be useful for. A pack animal or can I ride her? Is she a walker or can we gallop? Do I keep her in the stable or bring her out to show my friends?<br>That wasn&#x2019;t the way Nafai thought about women at all. Maybe because he was still in school, still talking to women every day about intellectual subjects. I&#x2019;m not in love with Eiadh because she&#x2019;s the most beautiful young woman in Basilica and therefore quite probably in the entire world. I&#x2019;m in love with her because we can talk together, because of the way she thinks, the sound of her voice, the way she cocks her head to listen to an idea she doesn&#x2019;t agree with, the way she rests her hand on mine when she&#x2019;s trying to persuade me.<br>Nafai suddenly realized that the sky was starting to grow light outside his window, and here he was lying in bed dreaming of Eiadh, when if he had any brains at all he&#x2019;d get up and get into the city and <em>see</em>her in person.<br>No sooner thought of than done. He sat up, knelt beside his mat, slapped his bare thighs and chest and offered the pain to the Oversoul, then rolled up his bed and put it in his box in the corner. I don&#x2019;t really need a bed, thought Nafai. If I were a real man I could sleep on the floor and not mind it. That&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;ll become as hard and lean as Father. As Elemak. I won&#x2019;t use the bed tonight.<br>He walked out into the courtyard to the water tank. He dipped his hands into the small sink, moistened the soap, and rubbed it all over. The air was cool and the water was cooler, but he pretended not to notice until he was lathered up. He knew that this chill was nothing compared to what would happen in a moment. He stood under the shower and reached up for the cord--and then hesitated, bracing himself for the misery to come.<br>&#x201c;Oh, just pull it,&#x201c; said Issib.<br>Nafai looked over toward Issib&#x2019;s room. He was floating in the air just in front of the doorway. &#x201c;Easy for <em>you</em>to say,&#x201c; Nafai answered him.<br>Issib, being a cripple, couldn&#x2019;t use the shower; his floats weren&#x2019;t supposed to get wet. So one of the servants took his floats off and bathed him every night. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a baby about cold water,&#x201c; said Issib.<br>&#x201c;Remind me to put ice down your neck at supper.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As long as you woke me up with all your shivering and chattering out here--&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t make a sound,&#x201c; said Nafai.<br>&#x201c;I decided to go with you into the city today.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Fine, fine. Fine as wine,&#x201c; said Nafai.<br>&#x201c;Are you planning to let the soap dry? It gives your skin a charming sort of whiteness, but after a few hours it might begin to itch.&#x201d;<br>Nafai pulled the cord.<br>Immediately ice-cold water cascaded out of the tank over his head. He gasped--it always hit with a shock--and then bent and turned and twisted and splashed water into every nook and crevice of his body to rinse the soap off. He had only thirty seconds to get clean before the shower stopped, and if he didn&#x2019;t finish in that time he either had to live with the unrinsed soap for the rest of the day--and it <em>did</em>itch, like a thousand fleabites--or wait a couple of minutes, freezing his butt off, for the little shower tank to refill from the big water tank. Neither consequence was any fun, so he had long since learned the routine so well that he was always clean before the water stopped.<br>&#x201c;I love watching that little dance you do,&#x201c; said Issib.<br>&#x201c;Dance?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bend to the left, rinse the armpit, bend the other way, rinse the left armpit, bend over and spread your cheeks to rinse your butt, bend over backward--&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right, I get it,&#x201c; said Nafai.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious, I think it&#x2019;s a wonderful little routine. You ought to show it to the manager of the Open Theatre. Or even the Orchestra. You could be a star.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A fourteen-year-old dancing naked under a stream of water,&#x201c; said Nafai. &#x201c;I think they&#x2019;d show that in a different kind of theatre.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But still in Dolltown! You&#x2019;d still be a hit in Dolltown!&#x201d;<br>By now Nafai had toweled himself dry--except his hair, which was still freezing cold. He wanted to run for his room the way he used to do when he was little, jabbering nonsense words--&#x201d;ooga-booga looga-booga&#x201d; had been a favorite--while he pulled on his clothes and rubbed himself to get warm. But he was a man now, and it was only autumn, not winter yet, so he forced himself to walk casually toward his room. Which is why he was still in the courtyard, stark naked and cold as ice, when Elemak strode through the gate.<br>&#x201c;A hundred and twenty-eight days,&#x201c; he bellowed.<br>&#x201c;Elemak!&#x201d; cried Issib. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re back!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No thanks to the hill robbers,&#x201c; said Elemak. He walked straight to the shower, pulling off his clothes as he went. &#x201c;They hit us only two days ago, way too close to Basilica. I think we killed one this time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know whether you did or not?&#x201d; asked Nafai.<br>&#x201c;I used the pulse, of course.&#x201d;<br>Of course? thought Nafai. To use a hunting weapon against a <em>person</em>?<br>&#x201c;I saw him drop, but I wasn&#x2019;t about to go back and check, so maybe he just tripped and fell down at the exact moment that I fired.&#x201d;<br>Elemak pulled the shower cord <em>before</em>he soaped. The moment the water hit him he yowled, and then did his own little splash dance, shaking his head and flipping water all over the courtyard while jabbering &#x201c;ooga-booga looga-booga&#x201d; just like a little kid.<br>It was all right for Elemak to act that way. He was twenty-four now, he had just got his caravan safely back from purchasing exotic plants in the jungle city of Tishchetno, the first time anyone from Basilica had gone <em>there</em>in years, and he might actually have killed a robber on the way. No one could think of Elemak as anything but a man. Nafai knew the rules: When a man acts like a child, he&#x2019;s boyish, and everyone&#x2019;s delighted; when a boy acts the same way, he&#x2019;s childish, and everyone tells him to be a man.<br>Elemak was soaping up now. Nafai--freezing still, even with his arms folded across his chest--was about to go into his room and snag his clothes, when Elemak started talking again.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve grown since I left, Nyef.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been doing that lately.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Looks good on you. Muscling up pretty well. You take after the old man in all the right ways. Got your mother&#x2019;s face, though.&#x201d;<br>Nafai liked the tone of approval in Elemak&#x2019;s voice, but it was also vaguely demeaning to stand there naked as a jaybird while his brother sized him up.<br>Issib, of course, only made it worse. &#x201c;Got Father&#x2019;s most important feature, fortunately,&#x201c; he said.<br>&#x201c;Well, we <em>all</em>got that,&#x201c; said Elemak. &#x201c;All of the old man&#x2019;s babies have been boys--or at least all his babies that we <em>know</em>about.&#x201d; He laughed.<br>Nafai hated it when Elemak talked about Father that way. Everyone knew that Father was a chaste man who only had sex with his lawful mate. And for the past fifteen years that mate had been Rasa, Nafai&#x2019;s and Issib&#x2019;s mother, the contract renewed every year. He was so faithful that women had given up coming to visit and hint around about availability when his contract lapsed. Of course, Mother was just as faithful and there were still plenty of men plying <em>her</em>with gifts and innuendoes--but that&#x2019;s how some men were, they found faithfulness even more enticing than wantonness, as if Rasa were staying so faithful to Wetchik only to goad them on in their pursuit of her. Also, mating with Rasa meant shari...</p></p><h2>Pathways to Understanding: Patterns and Practices in the Learning-Focused Classroom, 3rd Edition</h2><p>If you view learners as capable, creative and cognitive, if you view yourself as a facilitator rather than a director of learning, if you believe that the act of learning should be joyful - even euphoric - and if you hold the belief that the intent of education is not only for knowledge acquisition but for knowledge production, then ... read on!</p><p></p><h2>InuYasha, Vol. 11</h2><p>Follows the adventures of high school student Kagome and the feral half-demon dog-boy Inu-Yasha as they join forces to reclaim the &#34;Jewel of Four Souls&#34; to prevent evil mortals and demons from using its terrifying powers.</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi's career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan's annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens.

The story of inaction with enormous consequences and decisions that are never made, but for which people are judged and punished. <p></p>Middle sister is our protagonist. She is busy attempting to keep her mother from discovering her nearly-boyfriend and to keep everyone in the dark about her encounter with milkman (which she herself for the life of her cannot work out how it came about). But when first brother-in-law, who of course had sniffed it out, told his wife, her first sister, to tell her mother to come and have a talk with her, middle sister becomes 'interesting'. The last thing she ever wanted to be. To be interesting is to be noticed and to be noticed is dangerous...</p><p><b>Anna Burns</b> was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. She is the author of two novels, <i>No Bones</i> and <i>Little Constructions</i>, and of the novella, <i>Mostly Hero</i>. <i>No Bones</i> won the Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize and was short-listed for the Orange Prize for Fiction. She lives in East Sussex, England."From the outset, <i>Milkman</i> is delivered in a breathless, hectic, glorious torrent. The pace doesn't let up for a single moment.... <i>Milkman</i> can sometimes feel like a nerve-jangling reading experience; exhausting, even. Yet those who stick with Ann Burns' hectic, stream-of-consciousness writing, not dissimilar to that of Eimear McBride or Flann O'Brien, are more than rewarded. Her writing has been described as point-blank poetry," and rightly so. Her grasp on Middle sister's voice is so confident, and the textures of the environment, with its politics both big and small, are a thing to behold. It's an astute, exquisite account of Northern Ireland's social landscape, but Milkman is much more than that, too. It's also a coming-of-age story with flecks of dark humour, yet at other points it's a damning portrait of rape culture, and how women are often regarded in communities like this one. Because of this, Milkman is a potent and urgent book, with more than a hint of barely contained fury."--<i>Irish Independent</i><br><br>"Anna Burns is part of a movement of new and established female Belfast writers... along with Lucy Caldwell, Rois�n O'Donnell, Jan Carson and others. <i>Milkman</i> is both a story of Belfast and its particular sins but it is also a story of anywhere. It reminded me of China Mieville's <i>The City and the City</i> where identity, names and seeing the Other are contentious acts. <i>Milkman</i> shares this level of ambition; it is an impressive, wordy, often funny book and confirms Anna Burns as one of our rising literary stars."--<i>Irish Times</i><br><br>"The narrator of <i>Milkman</i> disrupts the status quo not through being political, heroic or violently opposed, but because she is original, funny, disarmingly oblique and unique: different."--<i>Guardian</i></p><h2>Paideia Problems &amp; Possibilities</h2><p>Explains the impact of the Paideia proposal on American education and discusses special education, vocational training, curricula, and other key topics</p><p></p><h2>The Assassination of New York</h2><p>Robert Fitch argues that, within a generation, New York City has been transformed from the richest city in the world to one of the poorest in North America. The pillars of its economy&#x2014;Macy&#x2019;s, the <i>Daily News</i>, Citibank, Olympia and York, the Trump organization&#x2014;have cracked or collapsed. Today, the officially poor in New York number nearly 2,000,000 and more than 400,000 residents of the city are without jobs.<br><br>In this indictment of those who have wrecked New York, Robert Fitch points to the financial and real-estate elites. Their goals, he argues, have been simple and monolithic: to increase the value of the land they own by extruding low-rent workers and factories, replacing them with high-rent professionals and office buildings. The planning establishment has been able of raise the value of real estate inside the city boundaries over twenty-fold. In doing so, Fitch suggests, it effectively closed New York&#x2019;s deep-water port, eliminated its freight rail system, shuttered its factories and destroyed its capacity for incubating new business.<br><br>Now the real-estate values have collapsed. The city is left with 65,000,000 square feet of office space&#x2014;enough to last, without any new building, to the middle of the twenty-first century. In pursuit of those who are responsible, Fitch arraigns the great and the bad of the city&#x2019;s establishment: Roger Starr, architect of &#x201c;planned shrinkage&#x201d; (the withdrawal of fire, police and mass transit services from black and Latino neighborhoods); the Ford Foundation, which proposed converting vast tracts of the South Bronx into a vegetable garden; City Hall fixers like John Zucotti, Herb Sturz and James Felt, who cut the deals between government and real estate by working for both sides; and the Rockefeller family, whose involuntary investment in the Rockefeller Center became a gigantic &#x201c;tar baby,&#x201d; nearly swallowing up their entire fortune.<br><br>Drawing on never-before-published material from the Rockefeller family archives, as well as other archival documents, this book aims to expose those responsible for the demise of New York.&nbsp;</p><p>The assassins of New York City, Fitch argues, were a group of powerful elites tied to the FIRE (financial, insurance and real estate) industries who began to influence city planning as far back as the Depression and still hold some power. According to the author, the goal of these people (whose ranks include the Rockefeller family) was to de-industrialize NYC so that their real estate holdings could be put to more profitable uses than manufacturing, namely the construction of large office buildings and luxury housing. Fitch ( Who Rules the Corporation ) provides a raft of statistics to document how the de-industrialization policy, which included the strangulation of the city's port, resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of blue-collar jobs, just as the elites had intended. However, the second phase of their plan--the creation of hundreds of thousands of white-collar jobs--never materialized, resulting in a city with a high unemployment rate and inadequate public services. Fitch details so many ill-conceived, FIRE-inspired master plans for New York City that the material becomes confusing and repetitious. In his zeal to document how the FIRE elites systematically murdered NYC, Fitch's book is more a treatise than a whodunit. Students of urban politics and planning will consider his information crucial, but more casual readers will find their minds wandering. Nonetheless, Fitch gives the average NYC resident plenty to get angry about, but holds out hope for the future by suggesting that a return to economic diversity could lead to a resurrected Gotham. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Fitch, who has taught urban studies and consulted for an organizations, is a modern-day muckraker. This is a passionate book, compelling even when one disagrees with details of Fitch's argument and even when he's patently wrong. He examines the destruction of New York's industrial base in favor of an intensely subsidized program of office construction; he offers a powerful, even ranting, indictment of the city's planning establishment. His book complements works like Jack Newfield and Paul DuBruhl's The Abuse of Power (1977) and is, in part, a critique of Robert Caro's The Power Broker (Vintage, 1975). Fitch sometimes lacks the sense of historical context that would put his archival research in perspective. Yet his book is an important attack on the prevailing notion that New York must make itself into a "postindustrial" city. One would like to see a copy in every New York library and in collections with a focus on urban planning, industrial policy, and municipal government.<br><i>- Gregory Gilmartin, New York</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Death Penalty (Opposing Viewpoints)</h2><p>Each title in the highly acclaimed Opposing Viewpoints series explores a specific issue by placing expert opinions in a unique pro/con format; the viewpoints are selected from a wide range of highly respected and often hard-to-find publications.; This title explores whether the death penalty is just and ethical, whether the death penalty serves the public good, whether the death penalty is applied fairly, and whether the death penalty should be abolished or reformed.; &#34;Each volume in the Opposing Viewpoints Series could serve as a model...not only providing access to a wide diversity of opinions, but also stimulating readers to do further research for group discussion and individual interest.

The longest poem, 'On Earth,' is a transcription of mind passing from life into death, in the form of an abecedary, modeled on ancient gnostic hymns. Other poems in the book, especially 'Nocturne' and 'Blue Hour,' are lyric recoveries of the act of remembering, though the objects of memory seem to us vivid and irretrievable, the rage to summon and cling at once fierce and distracted.</p><p></p>"The voice we hear in <em>Blue Hour</em> is a voice both very young and very old. It belongs to someone who has seen everything and who strives imperfectly, desperately, to be equal to what she has seen. The hunger to know is matched here by a desire to be new, totally without cynicism, open to the shocks of experience as if perpetually for the first time, though unillusioned, wise beyond any possible taint of a false or assumed innocence."<p></p><p>-- Robert Boyers</p><p></p></p><p><p>Carolyn Forch� is the author of <em>Gathering the Tribes,</em> winner of the Yale Younger Poets Award; <em>The Country Between Us,</em> which received awards from the Academy of American Poets and the Poetry Society of America; and <em>The Angel of History,</em> awarded the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Award. She is also the editor of the anthology <em>Against Forgetting: Twentieth-Centuly Poetry of Witness.</em> Recently she was presented with the Edita and Ira Morris Hiroshima Foundation Award for Peace and Culture in Stockholm. She lives in Maryland with her husband and son.</p>In addition to winning acclaim for her 1994 collection The Angel of History, Forch&#x201a; has been active as an anthologist (Against Forgetting: Twentieth Century Poetry of Witness) and translator of Georg Trakl, Claribel Alegria and, most recently, Mahmoud Darwish (Unfortunately, It Was Paradise), among others. The title of this fourth collection, her first since Angel, translates the French phrase for pre-dawn light into a state of mind that turns everything into a hypnopompic dream or bardic state. Forch&#x201a;'s speaker's memories (of childhood, of nursing her son in Paris) are intermingled with ethereal images of 20th century horror, and dosed with a mysticism derived from Heidegger and Buber. This puts her squarely in the territory of visionary abstraction Michael Palmer and Jorie Graham have been mining; like them, Forch&#x201a; is willing to let the contradictions of this technique speak for themselves. "In the Exclusion Zones," for example, is lovely and mysterious in its brevity, but is revealed in the endnotes to refer to the contaminated earth around Chernobyl. The book's tour de force, "On Earth," orders arrhythmic fragments alphabetically over 47 pages in the manner of "gnostic abecedarians," and foregrounds its lyric complications more concretely: "more ominous than any oblivion/ mortar smoke mistaken for an orchard of flowering pears." The poems' success ultimately rests in the reader's tolerance for gestures aimed at sensuality and sensibility in the face of atrocity, though the 10 or so shorter poems that precede "On Earth" are more modest in their ambitions, arousing and sating the longing for beauty with fewer attendant complications. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Russel Wright&#39;s Menu Cookbook: A Guide to Easier Entertaining</h2><p>The daughter of a modern design expert shares her father&#39;s collection of recipes, enhanced by his organizational methods, in a simple-to-use cookbook that covers the basics of modern convenience foods, setting a stylish table, and pleasurable entertaining.</p><p>Published here for the first time, Russel Wright&#39;s Menu Cookbook: A Guide to Easier Entertaining includes menus and recipes that are easy to execute, tast and look great, and appeal to the twenty-first-century palate. As a pioneer of midcentury modern design and lifestyle marketing, Russel Wright created some of the best-selling lines of china, flatware, glassware, and furniture. Half a century later, they are highly collectible. As a single father in the 1950s with a young daughter to raise, and faced with a parade of housekeepers who had little or no skill in organizing daily menus, Wright became tired of having meatloaf and spaghetti with meatballs for dinner several nights a week. So, he developed a repertoire of favorite recipes that were easy to execute in the kitchen. Tapping into his love of all kinds of food, recipes gathered in his travels and from friends, and his verging-on-obsessive organizational skills, Russel created a menu cookbook that anyone could use to create interesting, balanced, fuss-free meals. Bound together in a loose-leaf notebook, Russel&#39;s typewritten menus included instructions about which china, linens, and flatware to use for each menu, whether it was to be served it the Wrights&#39; Manhattan apartment or at Dragon Rock, their country home. Ann Wright, Russel&#39;s daughter, began cooking with these family recipes when whe was a child, and today, as a caterer and mother, she finds them as exciting and fresh as ever. She and fellow caterer Mindy Heiferling decided to share Russel Wright&#39;s vision with the world by re-creating Russel Wright&#39;s Menu Cookbook: A Guide to Easier Entertaining. Filled with tips on getting organized, how to use modern convenience foods like Thai red curry paste, store-bought sorbet, and barbecued duck from a Chinese restaurant, setting a stylish table, and making entertaining a pleasure rather than an ordeal, the fifteen-menu cookbook with sixty-five recipes provides an uncomplicated and creative approach to mealtime.N/A</p><h2>The River: A novel</h2><p><b>A NATIONAL BESTSELLER<br><br>"A fiery tour de force... I could not put this book down. It truly was terrifying and unutterably beautiful." &#x2013;Alison Borden,<i> The Denver Post</i><br><br></b>From the best-selling author of <i>The Dog Stars,</i> the story of two college students on a wilderness canoe trip--a gripping tale of a friendship tested by fire, white water, and violence<br><br>Wynn and Jack have been best friends since freshman orientation, bonded by their shared love of mountains, books, and fishing. Wynn is a gentle giant, a Vermont kid never happier than when his feet are in the water. Jack is more rugged, raised on a ranch in Colorado where sleeping under the stars and cooking on a fire came as naturally to him as breathing. When they decide to canoe the Maskwa River in northern Canada, they anticipate long days of leisurely paddling and picking blueberries, and nights of stargazing and reading paperback Westerns. But a wildfire making its way across the forest adds unexpected urgency to the journey. When they hear a man and woman arguing on the fog-shrouded riverbank and decide to warn them about the fire, their search for the pair turns up nothing and no one. But: The next day a man appears on the river, paddling alone. Is this the man they heard? And, if he is, where is the woman? From this charged beginning, master storyteller Peter Heller unspools a headlong, heart-pounding story of desperate wilderness survival.</p><p>PETER HELLER is the best-selling author of <i>Celine, The Painter </i>and <i>The Dog Stars.</i> He holds an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop in both fiction and poetry. An award-winning adventure writer and a longtime contributor to NPR, Heller has been a contributing editor at <i>Outside </i>magazine, <i>Men's Journal,</i> and <i>National Geographic Adventure, </i>and a regular contributor to<i> Bloomberg Businessweek.</i> He is also the author of several nonfiction books, including <i>Kook, The Whale Warriors,</i> and <i>Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River. </i>He lives in Denver, Colorado.<b>Prologue</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br> They had been smelling smoke for two days.<br><br> At first they thought it was another campfire and that sur�prised them because they had not heard the engine of a plane and they had been traveling the string of long lakes for days and had not seen sign of another person or even the distant movement of another canoe. The only tracks in the mud of the portages were wolf and moose, otter, bear.<br><br> The winds were west and north and they were moving north so if it was another party they were ahead of them. It per�plexed them because they were smelling smoke not only in early morning and at night, but would catch themselves at odd hours lifting their noses like coyotes, nostrils flaring.<br><br> And then one evening they pulled up on a wooded island and they made camp and fried a meal of lake trout on a driftwood fire and watched the sun sink into the spruce on the far shore. Late August, a clear night becoming cold. There was no aurora borealis, just the dense sparks of the stars blown from their own ancient fire. They climbed the hill. They did not need a headlamp as they were used to moving in the dark. Sometimes if they were feeling strong they paddled half the night. They loved how the darkness amplified the sounds&#x2014;the gulp of the dipping paddles, the knock of the wood shaft against the gunwale. The long desolate cry of a loon. The loons especially. How they hollowed out the night with longing.<br><br> Tonight there was no loon and almost no wind and they went up through tamarack and hemlock and a few large birch trees whose pale bark fluoresced. At the top of the knoll they fol�lowed a game trail to a ledge of broken rock as if they weren&#x2019;t the first who had sought the view. And they saw it. They looked northwest. At first they thought it was the sun, but it was far too late for any lingering sunset and there were no cities in that direction for a thousand miles. In the farthest distance, over the trees, was an orange glow. It lay on the horizon like the light from banked embers and it fluttered barely so they wondered if it was their eyes and they knew it was a fire.<br><br> A forest fire, who knew how far off or how big, but bigger than any they could imagine. It seemed to spread over two quad�rants and they didn&#x2019;t say a word but the silence of it and the way it seemed to breathe scared them to the bone. The prevail�ing wind would push the blaze right to them. At the pace they were going they were at least two weeks from the Cree village of Wapahk and Hudson Bay. When the most northerly lake spilled into the river they would pick up speed but there was no way to shorten the miles.<br><br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> On the morning after seeing the fire they did spot another camp. It was on the northeastern verge of a wooded island and they swung out to it and were surprised that no one was break�ing down the large wall tent. No one was going anywhere. There was an old white-painted square-stern woodstrip canoe on the gravel with a trolling motor clamped to the transom and two men in folding lawn chairs, legs sprawled straight. Jack and Wynn beached and hailed them and the men lifted their arms. They had a plastic fifth of Ancient Age bourbon on the stones between the chairs. The heavier one wore a flannel shirt and square steel-rimmed tinted glasses, the skinny one a Texans cap. Two spinning rods and a Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle leaned against a pine.<br><br> Jack said, &#x201c;You-all see the fire?&#x201d;<br><br> The skinny one said, &#x201c;You-all see any pussy?&#x201d; The men burst out laughing. They were drunk. Jack felt disgust, but being drunk on a summer morning didn&#x2019;t deserve a death sentence.<br><br> Jack said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a fire. Big-ass fire to the northwest. What you&#x2019;ve been smelling the last few days.&#x201d;<br><br> Wynn said, &#x201c;You guys have a satellite phone?&#x201d;<br><br> That set them off again. When they were finished laughing, the heavy one said, &#x201c;You two need to chillax. Whyn&#x2019;t you pull up a chair.&#x201d; There were no extra chairs. He lifted the bourbon by the neck between two fingers and rocked it toward them. Jack held up a hand and the man shrugged and brought the fifth up, watching its progress intently as though he was oper�ating a crane. He drank. The lake was a narrow reach and if the fire overran the western shore this island would not keep the men safe.<br><br> &#x201c;How&#x2019;ve you been making the portages?&#x201d; Jack said. He meant the carries between the lakes. There were five lakes, string�ing south to north. Some of the lakes were linked by chan�nels of navigable river, others by muddy trails that necessitated unloading everything and carrying. The last lake flowed into the river. It was a big river that meandered generally north a hundred and fifty miles to the Cree village and the bay. Jack was not impressed with the men&#x2019;s fitness level. <br><br> &#x201c;We got the wheely thing,&#x201d; the skinny man said. He made a sweeping gesture at the camp. <br><br> &#x201c;We got just about everything,&#x201d; the fat man said. <br><br> &#x201c;Except pussy.&#x201d; The two let out another gust of laughter. <br><br> Jack said, &#x201c;The fire&#x2019;s upwind. There. We figure maybe thirty miles off. It&#x2019;s a killer.&#x201d; <br><br> The fat man brought them into focus. His face turned serious. &#x201c;We got it covered,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Do you? It&#x2019;s all copacetic here. Whyn&#x2019;t you have a drink?&#x201d; He gestured at Wynn. &#x201c;You, the big one&#x2014;what&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Wynn.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the mean one, huh?&#x201d; The fat man cocked his head at Jack. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s his name? Go Home? Win or Go Home. Ha!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wynn didn&#x2019;t know what to say. Jack looked at them. He said, &#x201c;Well, you might get to high ground and take a look thataway one evening.&#x201d; He pointed across the lake. He didn&#x2019;t think either of them would climb a hill or a tree. He waved, wished them luck without conviction, and he and Wynn got in their canoe and left.<br><br> ***<br><br> On the third day after seeing the fire they were paddling the east shore of a lake called Blueberries. What it said on the map, and it was an odd name and no way to make it sound right. Blueberries Lake. They were paddling close to shore because the wind was up and straight out of the west and rocking them badly. It was a strange morning: a hard frost early that lingered and then the wind rose up and the black waves piled into them nearly broadside, rank on rank. The tops of the whitecaps blew into the sides of their faces and the waves lapped over the port gunwale so that they decided to surf into a cobble beach and they snapped on the spray deck that covered the open canoe. But there was fog, too. The wind tore into a dense mist and did not blow it away. Neither of them had ever seen anything like it.<br><br> They were paddling close to shore and they heard shouting. At first they thought it was birds or wolves. They didn&#x2019;t know what. As with the fire, they could not at first countenance the cause. Human voices were the last thing they expected but that&#x2019;s what it was. A man shouting and a woman&#x2019;s remonstra�tion, high and angry. The cries shredded in the wind. Wynn half turned in the bow and pointed with his paddle, but only for a second as they needed speed for headway or they would capsize. His gesture was a question: Should we stop?<br><br> An hour before, when they had beached to put on the spray skirt, they had landed hard. Wynn was heavier and having his weight in front had helped in the wind, but then they had surfed a wave into shore and thwomped onto the rocks, which thankfully were smooth; if the beach had been limestone shale they would have broken the boat. It was a dangerous maneuver. <br><br> They could not make out the words, but the woman sounded furious and the man did not sound menacing, just outraged. Jack shook his head. A couple might expect privacy in their home, why shouldn&#x2019;t they be granted the same in the mid�dle of nowhere? They could not see the figures or even the shore, but now and then there was an intimation of trees, just a shadow in the tearing fog, a dark wall which they knew was the edge of the forest, and they paddled on.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>THE THREE GOATS, SOFTCOVER, BEGINNING TO READ (BEGINNING-TO-READ BOOKS)</h2><p><p>Reading Levels vary with each set, but range from 1.0-1.3.</p> <p></p> <p>Give your primary students more varied book choices in a wider range of reading levels to meet both their interests and abilities successfully-and watch their skills soar!

The poems in his new collection, <em>Sweet Machine,</em> see the world from a new, hard-won perspective: A coming back to life, after so much death, a way of seeing the body's "sweet machine" not simply as a time bomb, but also as a vibrant, sensual, living thing. These poems are themselves "sweet machines"--lyrical, exuberant and joyous--and they mark yet another milestone in the extraordinary career of one of our most distinguished and accomplished poets.</p></p><p><p>Mark Doty's books of poetry and nonfiction prose have been honored with numerous distinctions, including the National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Martha Albrand Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and, in the United Kingdom, the T.

He is a professor at the University of Houston, and he lives in New York City. </p>&#34;Mark Doty says, &#39;What I love about language/is what I love about fog: /what comes between us and things/grants them shine.&#39; What comes between Mark Doty and the things in &#34;Sweet Machine&#34; is the sheerest translucent membrane of regard, the astonishing gloss of his eye&#39;s sweep and pinpoint--his luminous language. Nothing escapes his gaze and nothing--death, devastation, the ghost of a gesture--escapes its sheer insistence on beauty, the world &#39;lustered by the veil.&#39; Mark Doty is a master, re-painting our sad daily canvas, heightening the gold light, the diffusion, the shocked shattered glass and the artificial bath of attitude, letting us see it all arrayed, as he says, under the &#39;uncompromising vault of heaven.&#39;&#34; -- Carol Muske&#34;Having published the first poem and the last, I thought--having read the old poems too--I had known what to expect, but the senses are always new, and Doty&#39;s loyalty to them, and to the sense they make, continues to astonish, to enlighten, to console.&#34; -- Richard Howard&#34;Strange paradise, complete with worms&#39;, Mark Doty begins a poem. In four collections of poetry, this masterful poet writes elegies so full of life we find our hope restored. Moving, splendidly observant and unflinching, Mark Doty&#39;s poems extend the range of the American lyric poem.&#34;-- Citation for the Writer Bynner Prize for Poetry awared by the American Academy of Arts and Letters</p><h2>Culture as History: the Transformation of American Society in the Twentieth Century</h2><p>With amazing creativity, clarity, and wit, Warren Susman (1927-1985) takes us on a provocative tour of the highlights of American culture. By looking at all types of 20th-century culture&#x2014;highbrow, lowbrow, and middlebrow&#x2014;Susman shows how culture itself has become a battleground for competing visions of American life. Fourteen essays include such topics as the nature of American conservatism, the cultural contradictions of a consumer society, and the role of the urban experience in the development of American culture.</p><p>&#34;A brilliant achievement...a work of impassioned scholarship that I believe will become a classic in American cultural history.&#34; --Sacvan Bercovitch"Warren Susman has long been one of our most interesting and provocative cultural historians: shrewd in his choice of subjects, wise in his interpretations, pioneering in his approaches. This wonderful collection of pieces he has written over the past quarter century is cause. for rejoicing. Ranging from the Puritans to the modern city, from the frontier to the New York World's Fair of 1939, from Ralph Waldo Emerson to Babe Ruth, Susman presents us with a historical feast that both nourishes us with its images and ideas and leaves us hungry to test its suggestions and take up its intellectual challenges."<p>-- Lawrence W. Levine</p><p>"Warren Susman's essays have long been influential in American studies, and this book will have a transforming effect upon the field.

From finding the best building site to choosing stall latches, this book is chock full of how&#x2013;to tips. It explains in detail which materials are good to use around horses, and how good lighting, flooring, and ventilation make a big difference to both horses and people. And it goes beyond theory&#x2014;offering information, like how to estimate concrete and shingle a new roof or replace an old one.

Reprint.</p><p>Prolific children's book author Bruce Coville has delivered a down-to-earth unicorn tale, if such a thing is possible. <i>Song of the Wanderer</i>, the second book in The Unicorn Chronicles, delivers a neat follow-up to <i>Into the Land of the Unicorns</i>, unraveling mysteries and handily reweaving new ones just as fast. The world of the unicorns, Luster, is carefully and cohesively imagined, with myths and rules and prejudices that seem logical and organic. Readers will thrill to the story of Cara, an earth girl who becomes both ward and savior of the unicorns. She must travel through Luster--a world replete with all manner of secret caves and rainbow prisons and talking seashells--back to earth to try to find her grandmother, the Wanderer. The episodic structure of the book is satisfying; Coville delivers all the de rigueur scenes, including a makeover, wherein a Geomancer provides Cara with clothing appropriate to her journey: "To finish the outfit, she strapped a short sword to Cara's side. 'May you never have to use it,' whispered the Geomancer." (The rest of us hope otherwise.) Coville hurries his heroine past some flat characterizations through clever, well-thought-out plot points. And he leaves his ending compellingly open, as befits a series: Luster resounds with rumors of "the possibility of a fierce, final battle that would decide the ancient struggle between the unicorns and the Hunters once and for all." Stay tuned, unicorn lovers. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>Song of The Wanderer is a multi-voiced recording featuring author Bruce Coville himself as narrator and a talented group of actors who bring to life the each of the fantastical creatures in a way that will delight young and old alike. Reminiscent of classic radio drama, this magical audiobook is even better because it contains the full, unabridged text.

Certainly, they can do things the rest of us can't, but they have the same muscles and require the same food. They have to strike a balance between exercise and recovery, or they'll wear down. They need to get leaner and stronger without compromising their endurance or flexibility. And if they don't train intelligently and cautiously, they'll get hurt. Same as you. </p><p>Of course, athletes have hours a day to train, and you're probably lucky if you can squeeze in 60 minutes. So it's no wonder that you focus on one or two types of exercise--aerobics, bodybuilding, Pilates, yoga, kickboxing, or Tae-Bo--and assume you don't have time to work on all the other aspects of fitness. </p><p><i>Core Performance</i> is the first program that delivers strength and muscle mass, endurance and a lean body, balance and flexibility, athletic quickness and power--all in less than an hour a day. How? By giving you a personal coach who has worked with some of the most famous and successful athletes in the world today. </p><p>Mark Verstegen, owner of Athletes' Performance in Tempe, Arizona, and Carson, California, has trained the best of the best: Nomar Garciaparra. Mia Hamm. Roberto Alomar. Mary Pierce. When Verstegen trains an athlete, millions of dollars in salary and signing bonuses are at stake. Bottom line: If he didn't deliver, he'd be out of business. And he's busier than ever. <br>What works for these gifted athletes will work for you. Sure, you can't do as much exercise as they do, but you don't need to. It takes less than an hour a day to build the type of fitness that improves your life in almost every way. You can straighten your posture, eliminate aches and pains, sleep better, and approach everything you do with more vigor and a better attitude. <br>Sure, you will get bigger muscles, a tighter waist, and more strength and power. But the biggest benefits come from the inside. The intense focus on the muscles of your core--abdominals, lower back, hips, and thighs--will help you stand taller and prevent the back pain from which most people eventually suffer. The detailed nutrition section guarantees that you'll feed your muscles, starve your fat, and get boundless energy when you need it most. And the attention you'll pay to recovery from your workouts will give you a straight path to the results you want. </p><p>li0The potential is within you, and the power to unleash that potential is within Core Performance.</p></p><p><p><b>Mark Verstegen</b> directs a 25-person team of performance specialists and nutritionists to train some of the biggest names in sports, including soccer star Mia Hamm; baseball's Nomar Garciaparra, Roberto Alomar, and Vernon Wells; WTA tennis players Meghann Shaughnessy and Mary Pierce; golfers Jim Carter and Billy Mayfair; NFL veteran Trace Armstrong; hockey goalie Nikolai Khabibulin; and NBA forward Rick Fox.

Since 1988, he has written a regular column for BBC Wildlife Magazine, and is on their advisory board. He also writes for The Sunday Times, The Times, The Sunday Telegraph and The Countryman. He is the author of over 30 books on the countryside, including the award-winning Flora Britannica, Birds Britannica and Nature Cure.Rousseau wrote that "the study of nature abates the taste for frivolous amusements, prevents the tumult of passions and provides the mind with a nourishment which is salutary," and, indeed, the genteel art of botanical drawing was a prevalent pastime among Victorian "ladies" of leisure. The collaborative efforts of two generations of Victorian women comprise this accomplished collection of flower paintings recently discovered in the attic of the Clifford family estate, Frampton Court, in Gloucestershire, England. British nature writer Mabey keenly suggests that the assortment of "humdrum" flowers from the environs of Frampton and more exotic blooms found in the wilder countryside reflects the peculiarly Victorian ambivalence toward the "twin passions of domesticity and expansiveness." While the pieces here are skillfully executed, the handiwork of Charlotte Anne Purnell and Rosamond Clifford is distinguished by a luminous texture and sophisticated sense of design. The paintings are grouped by locale, invoking a sense of the women having constructed a " 'permanent geography' of their ancestral territory." The assiduously studied, delicately restrained flowers provide a telling account not only of the flora of a lost age, but of the refined industriousness of their portraitists. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The San Fernando Valley: America&#39;s Suburb</h2><p>A journalist and native son of the San Fernando Valley, arguably America's quintessential suburb, returns to his<p>old neighborhoods and discovers a long, rich history filled with the sort of lore and traditions that make a place a home.</p></p><p>Kevin Roderick came to the subject of the San Fernando Valley both as a curious journalist and as a product himself of the suburbs.

Bodie's goal seemed impossible, however, when midway through grade school it was discovered that she had dyslexia, a learning disability that made it difficult for her to read. Her mother refused to accept that this was a problem they couldn't overcome, and together they worked with a young teacher until at last Bodie could read at grade level and above. </p> <p>"Both my parents instilled their can-do outlook on life. Reading opened the world to me. I began to write stories of my own." </p> <p>By the young age of fourteen, Bodie had a job as a stringer reporter for The California Newspaper. "They paid me fifty cents an inch for one article a week. The most I ever made was twelve dollars, but I felt rich!"</p> <p>Bodie continued her college education as a Journalism-Political Science major in San Jose, California. She covered the Bay-area political unrest of the Vietnam era as an associate for <i>U.S. News and World Report.</i> Her career as a journalist seemed assured, but she says, "I thought to myself that there has to be more to life than writing about riots and peace marches."</p> <p>Bodie married Brock Thoene during their sophomore year in college. They settled in Waco, Texas, where Brock attended Baylor University. It was here that Bodie began to write fiction out of the stories she gleaned from old Texas cowboys. The birth of their first child did not stop her from writing. "I held her with one arm and typed with the other!"</p> <p>Publication of <i>The Fall Guy</i> catapulted Bodie into national attention and acclaim. Shortly after that she went to work for John Wayne's Batjac Productions and ABC Television as a writer and researcher, working with the top writers in the motion picture industry. Among those who work with her, she is known as one of the finest character and action writers in the business. Her work is currently featured in <i>American West, Saturday Evening Post, </i>and <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine, as well as other national publications. </p> <p>Bodie's interest in Israel, which culminated in THE ZION CHRONICLES, stems from her days as a student. In 1978 she spoke to John Wayne about her hope to one day write a novel about the exciting events surrounding the rebirth of Israel. He encouraged her with his reply: "That's one you ought to do.

From the Official Manuals of the U.S. Army.</p><p></p><h2>Burma: The Longest War 1941-1945</h2><p>Charting the whole Burma war, this book flows like a novel from the high command to the sharp end setting out a myriad of facts and considerations in a clear and coherent narrative. Ranging far beyond pure military history the story is multi-layered, combining objective analysis with a sensitive account of human reaction in the face of bitter, cruel warfare, disease and an inhospitable terrain. Military events are painstakingly detailed, and set in their political and cultural context. Equal attention is paid to both sides of the conflict and the insights made into Japanese plans and responses make the book uniquely informative, exciting and moving. <p>'If one had to select one book about the Burma War, this fine work is the best' Dekho, magazine of the Burma Star Association </p><p>'There will be few more thorough chronicles of World War Two's most dreaded front than Louis Allen's Burma: The Longest War' The Listener</p></p><p>Louis Allen fought in Burma from 1941-45 and has a thorough understanding of Japanese language and culture. He writes from his own experiences and draws upon exhaustive research from Japanese, British and US official histories, apologias, reminiscences, generals&#39; biographies, diaries and newspaper reports.Himself a veteran of the Southeast Asia operations of WW II and a Japanese linguist, Allen (The End of the War in Asia, Singapore 194142) has written a formidable and impressive history of the Burma campaign. In 1942, Japan conquered the country in short order, driving the Allied forces into India. The Allies launched a counteroffensive that would take almost three years to succeed, the task made even more difficult because the "racialism, arrogance, aloofness and greed" of English rule had left the Burmese anti-British. Much of the Allied campaign was waged in the jungle, with its concomitants of malaria, typhus, amoebic dysentery, anemia and foot-rot, against a foe whom Allen presents as brave and tenacious. Indeed, one of the more remarkable features of the book is the picture of Japanese officers, free of the stereotypes of samurai sword-wielding sadists. The book will no doubt be controversial, however, because Allen implies that the U.S. contribution to victory in Burma was minor. Photos.

The objects of these critiques are the Christian Church and the Christian belief system. The &#x201c;very few&#x201d; to whom the book is addressed are those &#x201c;hyperboreans&#x201d; who possess &#x201c;the courage for the <i>forbidden</i>;&#x201d; those who &#x201c;thirst for thunderbolts and great deeds.&#x201d; The author and critic is Friedrich Nietzsche: philosopher, psychologist, poet, and &#x201c;the last disciple and initiate of the god Dionysus.&#x201d; In earlier books Nietzsche had made that most profound announcement: &#x201c;God is dead.&#x201d; In other words, there are no absolute, unconditional, or objective values in the world. Whatever meanings that exist in life are put there by us, by human beings, by &#x201c;value-creators.&#x201d; <i>The Antichrist</i> was intended as the first part of a four-part work to be titled <i>The Revaluation of All Values</i>&#x2014;Nietzsche&#x2019;s desire to lay bare the psychological, social, and cultural weaknesses that humanity has imposed upon itself over the past two thousand years, and to point to a higher sense of health and creative development and responsibility for the future. An outline of this proposed work provides the following scheme: (1) The Antichrist: Attempt at a Critique of Christianity; (2) The Free Spirit: Critique of Philosophy as a Nihilistic Movement; (3) The Immoralist: Critique of the Most Fatal Kind of Ignorance, Morality; and (4) Dionysus: Philosophy of Eternal Recurrence. <i>The Antichrist</i> is all that we have of this ambitious enterprise, which was the last flash of creative frenzy before Nietzsche&#x2019;s mind was dimmed by madness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was born in the village of R�cken in Saxony on October 15, 1844. His father, Karl Ludwig, was a Lutheran pastor who passed away when his son was only four years old, owing to &#x201c;softening of the brain.&#x201d; Nietzsche and his younger sister, Elisabeth, were raised by their mother, Franziska, and their two maiden aunts. In 1858, he was admitted to the <i>Pfortaschule</i>, the most prestigious boarding school in Germany. After six years of the regimented life there, he spent a year as a theology student at the University of Bonn, then in 1865, he began the study of classical philology at the University of Leipzig. Nietzsche&#x2019;s literary career began with the publication in 1872 of <i>The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music</i>. The book&#x2019;s characterization of the creative impetus behind Greek drama in terms of a synthesis of the destructive &#x201c;Dionysian&#x201d; and the constructive &#x201c;Apollinian&#x201d; impulses, and its description of the Socratic attitude of reason over instinct as one of decadence, represents a seminal moment for the subsequent development of Nietzsche&#x2019;s thought. However, with its hyperbolic praise of his friend, the composer Richard Wagner (1813&#x2013;83), the book did little to further Nietzsche&#x2019;s budding career as a professor of classical philology at Basel University in Switzerland. His friendship with Wagner, though, soon soured, and by 1878, they had become openly antagonistic toward one another. The following year Nietzsche resigned his teaching position at Basel, owing to the recurring health problems that plagued him throughout his life. These included severe eye pain and vision problems, intense headaches that would last for days, stomach and intestinal distress resulting in prolonged fits of vomiting, and chronic insomnia. Despite poor health and desperate loneliness, Nietzsche managed to produce a book (or a book-length supplement to an earlier publication) every year from 1878 to 1887. From 1883 to 1885, he published the four parts of his most famous work, <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>, in which he introduced his idea of the &#x201c;overman&#x201d; (<i>�bermensch</i>) and developed his conception of &#x201c;the will to power&#x201d; and his doctrine of &#x201c;the eternal recurrence of the same.&#x201d; During the fall of 1888, in a flurry of energy and euphoria, Nietzsche wrote or completed four books: <i>Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist,</i> <i>Ecce Homo,</i> and <i>Nietzsche Contra Wagner</i>. In early January 1889, he collapsed in the street in Turin, Italy, confused and incoherent. He spent the last eleven years of his life institutionalized or under the care of his family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nietzsche&#x2019;s task, as he described it in <i>Ecce Homo</i>, his intellectual autobiography, was to uncover &#x201c;the greatest uncleanliness that humanity has on its conscience; a self-deception become instinctive.... Blindness to Christianity is the crime <i>par excellence</i>&#x2014;the crime against life.&#x201d; (<i>Ecce Homo</i>, IV, 7.)&nbsp; This was a task that he took very seriously. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I know my fate. One day my name will be associated with the memory of something tremendous&#x2014;a crisis without equal on earth, the most profound collision of conscience, a decision that was conjured up <i>against</i> everything that had been believed, demanded, hallowed so far. I am no man, I am dynamite. (<i>Ecce Homo</i>, IV, 1.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The full force of this man made dynamite was Nietzsche&#x2019;s last and greatest undertaking: <i>The Revaluation of All Values</i>. In a letter dated October 18, 1888, to his friend Franz Overbeck Nietzsche writes:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s my greatest harvest time. Everything comes easy now, everything I do thrives, although I think hardly anyone has ever undertaken such momentous things. That the first volume of the <i>Revaluation of All Values</i> is finished, ready for printing [i.e., <i>The Antichrist</i>]&#x2014;I tell you this with a feeling I can&#x2019;t put into words. There&#x2019;ll be four books, appearing separately. This time, old artilleryman that I am, I&#x2019;m moving in my big guns. I fear I&#x2019;ll be blasting the history of mankind into two halves.... (<i>Nietzsche: A Self-Portrait from His Letters, 126.</i>)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><i>The Antichrist</i> is not intended for the timid or the faint of heart. It seethes with contempt for what Nietzsche regards as mankind&#x2019;s greatest crime&#x2014;Christianity&#x2019;s imposition, upon humanity, of its perverse and unnatural vision. Thematically the book stands with <i>Daybreak, Beyond Good and Evil, On the Genealogy of Morals, </i>and <i>Twilight of the Idols</i>. In each of these books Nietzsche had diagnosed Christian morality and values as the sources of our modern social and psychological maladies. Yet it is important to keep in mind that Nietzsche&#x2019;s criticisms are aimed at Christianity, understood as &#x201c;organized religion,&#x201d; &#x201c;the Christian Church,&#x201d; or, to use Kierkegaard&#x2019;s idiom, &#x201c;Christiandom.&#x201d; Nietzsche makes this point in his notebooks: &#x201c;What did Christ <i>deny</i>? Everything that is today called Christian&#x201d; (<i>The Will to Power</i>, � 158.).&nbsp; In <i>The Antichrist</i> the point is made with a more pithy sentiment: &#x201c;truth to tell, there never was more than one Christian, and he <i>died</i> on the Cross&#x201d; (� 39). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An analysis of the corrupting character of Christianity is the <i>modus operandi</i> of <i>The Antichrist</i>. Overall, the book is a negative, critical work. It was intended to clear the ground for the more positive discussions in the subsequent parts of <i>The Revaluation of All Values</i>. Nietzsche contends that the corruption here is manifold. First, the natural world and our instincts are sacrificed for a fantastic apparition dredged up by unhealthy imaginations. Second, the values offered, the ideals to which we aspire, are created by people who are not qualified to create such values and ideals. These meanings and goals are unnatural distortions of reality provided by people who are themselves divorced from reality, and who seek to instill in others the same dissatisfaction with this world which infects them. Thus, the priests and theologians create in others the same psychological distress and dis-integration from which they themselves suffer, and then proffer the cure. Third, the so-called source of the values and meanings of reality, the Christian God, represents, for Nietzsche, the low watermark in divine types. In the past, a people or culture created gods as expressions of its will to power, as manifestations of its abundance of creative energy. The Jewish God, Jehovah, was such an expression in its original conception as rainmaker and helper of the Jewish people. According to Nietzsche, later, after internal turmoil and external invasions, the Jewish priests &#x201c;denaturalized&#x201d; Jehovah, turning him into a moral world-orderer and judge. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this context we find one of the great ironies that Nietzsche expresses so well. It has to do with the relationship between the God represented in Judaism and the God of Christianity. Despite his intolerance of anti-Jewish prejudices, some of Nietzsche&#x2019;s friends and acquaintances counted among the most notable anti-Semites of the period. These included Nietzsche&#x2019;s brother-in-law, Bernhard F�rster, and, of course, Richard Wagner. Much of their rhetoric was spent in dissociating the &#x201c;primitive&#x201d; Jewish God of the Old Testament from the enlightened Christian God of the New Testament. Nietzsche contends that the Christian conception of God grew from the same soil as the Jewish conception, and that both are grounded in the same anti-natural attitudes of herd resentment. The difference consists in the fact that Judaism remained more or less exclusive to a single culture while Christianity opened the doors to every kind of disenfranchised group or belief system in the vastly diverse Roman Empire. Thus, Christianity &#x201c;had to become as morbid, base and vulgar as the needs to which it had to minister were morbid, base and vulgar&#x201d; (<i>The Antichrist</i>, � 37).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its negative, critical tone, its thunder and its lightning, a rainbow does appear in <i>The Antichrist</i>. Here and elsewhere in his writings, Nietzsche&#x2019;s diagnosis of the Christian dis-ease is both an indictment of past crimes and an inducement for future virtues. Consider, for example, the virtue of pity. According to Nietzsche, the Christian conception of pity functions to drain the strength and the power of those who pity, and it serves to preserve the existence of those whom nature has, in many cases, written off. But there is another, healthier kind of pity, one that is grounded in an altogether different motive. In <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>, he states the matter the following way:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Our</i> pity is a higher and more farsighted pity: we see how <i>man</i> makes himself smaller, how you make him smaller.... You want, if possible&#x2014;and there is no more insane &#x201c;if possible&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>to abolish suffering</i>. And we? It really seems that <i>we</i> would rather have it higher and worse than ever.... The discipline of suffering, of <i>great</i> suffering&#x2014;do you not know that only <i>this</i> discipline has created all enhancements of man so far? (� 225) </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>, Nietzsche draws a distinction between degenerative virtues and motives, and the generative or <i>gift-giving</i> motivation or virtue. While the former motives are grounded in a kind of neurotic lack or need in a person&#x2019;s psyche, the latter expresses itself in terms of an over-abundance of goodwill. It was the gift-giving virtue that compelled Zarathustra to leave his cave after ten years of solitary reflection and to&nbsp; &#x201c;go under,&#x201d; i.e., to return to the realm of human beings to share his wisdom: &#x201c;like a bee that has gathered too much honey; I need hands out-stretched to receive it.... Bless the cup that wants to overflow, that the water may flow from it golden and carry everywhere the reflection of your delight&#x201d; (Zarathustra&#x2019;s Prologue, 1). It is the gift-giving virtue that expresses the love that the higher human has for his or her fellow human beings:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your virtue. Let your gift-giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the earth. Thus I beg and beseech you. Do not let them fly away from earthly things and beat with their wings against eternal walls.... Lead back to the earth the virtue that flew away, as I do&#x2014;back to the body, back to life, that it may give the earth a meaning, a human meaning. (<i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>, I, 22, ii)&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>The Antichrist</i>, the motive is the same even if the voice is shriller and the palliative is more caustic:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing is more unhealthy in the midst of our unhealthy modernity, than Christian pity. To be doctors <i>here</i>, to be inexorable <i>here</i>, to wield the knife effectively <i>here</i>&#x2014;all this is our business, all this is <i>our</i> kind of love to our fellows, this is what makes <i>us</i> philosophers, us hyperboreans! (� 7)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Greek mythology, the Hyperboreans were separated from the world of men by a vast distance of space: they dwelled far to the north in an unknown realm of the world. Nietzsche&#x2019;s new Hyperboreans are (or will be) separated from his world by a vast distance of time. They are the philosophers of the future. His audience was, as yet, unborn. And as for the author himself: &#x201c;Only the day after tomorrow belongs to me. Some are born posthumously&#x201d; (<i>The Antichrist</i>, preface).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While some are born posthumously, Nietzsche&#x2019;s arrival in the twentieth century may be seen as a posthumous miscarriage. It is one of the saddest ironies in the history of ideas that his works were so misrepresented and misused by anti-Semites and by German nationalist organizations after his mental collapse. Nietzsche&#x2019;s position regarding the &#x201c;German&#x201d; nation, spirit, people, etc., is clear from his many reference to these subjects. After a moment of patriotic fervor during the Franco-Prussian War, he completely rejected Bismarck&#x2019;s expansionist policies and the attitudes that characterized the &#x2018;new Germany&#x2019; of the <i>zweite Reich</i>, as well as the idealized conception of the &#x201c;good German.&#x201d; These views were clearly expressed, for example, in <i>Daybreak</i>, book 3; in <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>, part 8, &#x201c;Peoples and Fatherlands&#x201d;; and in <i>Twilight of the Idols</i>, part 8, &#x201c;What the Germans Lack.&#x201d; His criticism of the Germans is essentially criticism of the kind of sentimental, narrow-minded shallowness which he regarded as prevalent characteristics of German <i>Kultur</i> during the 1870s and 1880s. But there was a more sinister poison at work here as well, one that went hand in hand with the rise of German nationalism. This was the poison of anti-Semitism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nietzsche&#x2019;s views concerning the place and contribution of the Jews to German culture and to European culture in general were stated very well in his early aphoristic work, <i>Human, All Too Human</i>. These views never really changed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Zapped: Why Your Cell Phone Shouldn&#39;t Be Your Alarm Clock and 1,268 Ways to Outsmart the Hazards of Electronic Pollution</h2><p><p>A groundbreaking expos� of the hidden truths of electropollution, <em>Zapped</em> is the first comprehensive, step-by-step guide to counteracting the invisible hazards of everyday electromagnetic exposure.

We didn&#x2019;t know it then, but the kids of the Great Depression, a deprived generation, were preparing for war&#x2014;and we were becoming damned good at it, even before we laid hands on a weapon.<br>For me, the New York of my time was the New York of <i>all</i> time.<br>It is a lost New York. Lost to the years, now, but very much a product of its own time, as farmsteads and subway lines spit in the palms of their hands and shook on it as if it still meant something. Wiseguys could be seen standing on the street corners on Saturday afternoons, ogling the girls and shootin&#x2019; the shit&#x2014;and then later that afternoon the same bunch would hitch a truck out to the potato farms, in Suffolk County and Montauk Point, and then back again, each time seeing how far they could make it out.<br>So when my family moved out to Queens, before I was born, all of our relatives from Brooklyn laughed and said we were moving out to the country. Yet my dad probably took the electric train to get there!<br>We were the <i>overflow</i> of Queens during the Great Depression.<br>From our home on 123rd Street, down the back of 128th Street, was &#x201c;Little Italy,&#x201d; where the Italians (we called them guineas back then) would throw all sorts of exotic and colorful festivities. They&#x2019;d have a feast, with food stalls dotting the sidewalks, selling greasy sausages and fat cannolis. Confetti littered the streets. There were loud voices everywhere, and chirping children ran between the legs of their <i>padri</i> and <i>madri.</i><br>Then me and my pals, when we got old enough, we&#x2019;d swagger through the crowd, browsing for those cute little Italian girls, trying to romance them amid the spinning wheels, bright lights, and games of chance (which I swear were rigged, because those &#x201c;games&#x201d; would clean you out quicker than those Italian girls could heist your heart).<br>When I returned home for the night, empty-handed and empty-hearted, I would lie in bed, hands propped behind my head, listening to the caterwauling of the Italian opera singers as they cut loose for the last time before they closed down the show. Then the fireworks would go off.<br>I could hear the pops, bangs, and whizzes of the pyrotechnics as the reds, yellows, and oranges smeared lightscapes across my bedroom window.<br>Even after the war, I lay there, watching the sounds and listening to the sights, as they held another feast, while consciously I tried to equate those sensations to the things I had experienced in the Pacific.<br>The fireworks wouldn&#x2019;t shake me up or anything. I wouldn&#x2019;t become frightened. Although they were pretty close.<br>I was pretty close.<br>It was simply a unique time for all of us in Queens, from the skunk cabbage farms in South Ozone to the Aqueduct Racetrack on Rockaway to places people today never heard of, like Cornell Park and Richmond Hill Circle. Queens was popping with civilization, as one million immigrants and natives shared a commonality that not many people do today. Yet as America wore the face of tragedy in the reflection of the stock market crash of 1929, my Queens, too, was no exception. Beneath the tough lessons of meager meals and Home Relief, there was a flipside to our disposition&#x2014;the mask of comedy, which diametrically opposed the Depression that assailed us: the double-sided Greek mask of classic theater. We had to keep ourselves in clover, despite knowing better. Despite ourselves.<br>Then a miracle happened, when I was eleven years old&#x2014;Christmas morning 1935.<br>It didn&#x2019;t change anything, yet to me it changed <i>everything.</i><br>Mickey and I flew down the stairs that Christmas morning, screeching to a halt in front of the tree out on the porch. The sparkle in our eyes surely eclipsed the glamour of promises that lay beneath the traditional tree.<br>For traditionally, under the tree, there might be the same wooden canoe I received the year before, but this year Dad had painted it a different color, so that it looked great again. Or I had a metal dirigible, which got the same treatment a couple of times&#x2014;painted up, or polished nice to give it a new shine. Rounding out our Christmas bounty, Mom and Dad put an orange, maybe an apple, and a few walnuts in the stockings that hung in front of our false-front fireplace. It didn&#x2019;t matter what I got for Christmas, though. It didn&#x2019;t matter if it was something new or a little bit of the old stuff. The happiness my family shared on Christmas had a lot to do with just being together&#x2014;and also knowing that there were some children, like the kids who lived in the shantytown of Cornell Park, with their dirt roads and swamps, who were probably getting whippings on Christmas morning, just to set their minds right for the coming New Year.<br>Besides, we had a good roof over our heads. Our home on Panama (123rd) Street was small but comfortable. Dad had paid $2,300 for it, so that made it ours. It was a three-bedroom bungalow, with my room fairly cramped, being situated on the top floor where the roof pitched down at a slant. Mickey was upstairs also, but her bedroom was larger than mine; she got first dibs because of her age. Mom and Dad took the downstairs bedroom, coming off of the living room; then there was a small dining room and a kitchen. That was it.<br>We could have been a lot worse off.<br>Dad even had a car, a 1927 Essex, which was great, but we couldn&#x2019;t afford the antifreeze for it when the winter bit deep enough, so Dad would have to pour water into the radiator as a coolant. Water worked fine, until you parked the car for about three seconds. A case in point: One winter, Dad took a WPA job, building Jacob Riis Park; as he got ready to leave for the day, he went out to the Essex and tried to turn the motor over, only to find the car wouldn&#x2019;t start because the engine was a solid block of ice. Being the logical guy that Dad was, he built a fire under the motor with some old wood, so that after a while the water thawed and he was able to ride home again.<br>Even our clothes, growing up, were strictly the cheap stuff.<br>Mickey and I got our clothes from a handout store on 119th Street, where the uniform of the day was always brown corduroy knickers, black shoes, and black stockings. It seemed that everybody wore nothing but black in those days. And those shoes? Everyone was given a pair of size D shoes, even if they had size EEE feet. For three years I walked around with sores on my heels, trying to get into those damned lace-ups.<br>It was later, when I was in the Marine Corps, that I remembered those shoes, when I saw how happy the rednecks in our platoon were when they received their U.S.-issue boondockers&#x2014;which, as it turned out, were the first shoes they&#x2019;d ever owned in their lives.<br>It was funny, and we New Yorkers would crack wise at the Rebels; nevertheless, it brought back a certain thankfulness for how lucky some of us were, compared to those who had grown up in the Dust Bowl days of the Great Depression. Yet which one of us could claim we were unaffected by the hard knocks of our era? There wasn&#x2019;t a single marine who didn&#x2019;t have at least one drum to beat over the want and worry of the 1930s.<br>Even in 1943, as we marines took the train from Camp Lejeune to California, crossing into Georgia, the call of the Depression still knew every one of us by name. The train made frequent stops, and little black children ran up to our open windows and began dancing, performing, for any change that we&#x2019;d throw out to them. They didn&#x2019;t know any different; they still smiled and danced, kicking up puffs of dust around their ankles. They were maybe seven or eight years old, dirty from head to toe, and living in dry wooden shacks. I even recall one such &#x201c;home&#x201d; being constructed out of the back end of a rusted automobile.<br>Those poor children probably didn&#x2019;t even know what a Christmas morning was.<br>Eight years earlier, however&#x2014;before I had any notion of the Marine Corps, or of death from Japan&#x2014;happiness abounded in a little corner of New York, when I saw the miracle behind our Christmas tree.<br>It was the greatest gift a boy could ask for.<br>Somehow (<i>gasp!</i>), some way (<i>it&#x2019;s the most ...</i></p><h2>The Message: New Testament (Mass Market Edition)</h2><p>Written in the same kind of language you&#39;d use to talk with friends, write a letter, or discuss politics, The Message preserves the authentic, earthy flavor and expressive character of the Bible.

If this is how you&#x2019;ve always viewed the New Testament, you&#x2019;re about to make a surprising discovery. One of the most striking features of the New Testament is that it was written in the street language of the day&#x2013;&#x2013;the idiom of the playground and marketplace, not the formal, lofty language of government decrees and historical documents.

Almost everyone in Xanth--whether centaur, ogre, human, or unicorn--has a magical ability, and uses it to wreak complicated and amusing mayhem. Quests to restore order are the order of the day. This hardcover volume contains the complete texts of books four, five, and six in the Xanth series--<i>Centaur Aisle</i>, in which the future monarch of Xanth, 16-year-old Dor, has to negotiate with nonmagical Mundania; <i>Ogre, Ogre</i>, which tells the romantic story of an Eye Queue-enhanced ogre and a lovely nymph; and <i>Night Mare</i>, in which Imbri, a former night mare, must help stave off the invasion of Xanth by Nextwave barbarians. The first novel in this series, <i>A Spell for Chameleon</i>, appeared in 1977. Piers Anthony is an exceedingly popular author, and the humorous and long-lived Xanth series is why. <i>--Blaise Selby</i></p><h2>The Carpenter&#39;s Lady</h2><p>Carpenter&#39;s Lady, The, New Edition</p><p></p><h2>Child 44 (The Child 44 Trilogy, 1)</h2><p><strong>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novel that inspired the major motion picture starring Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace<br><i><br>In a country ruled by fear, no one is innocent.</i><br></strong><br>Stalin's Soviet Union is an official paradise, where citizens live free from crime and fear only one thing: the all-powerful state. Defending this system is idealistic security officer Leo Demidov, a war hero who believes in the iron fist of the law. But when a murderer starts to kill at will and Leo dares to investigate, the State's obedient servant finds himself demoted and exiled. Now, with only his wife at his side, Leo must fight to uncover shocking truths about a killer-and a country where "crime" doesn't exist.<strong><br></strong></p><p>If all that Tom Rob Smith had done was to re-create Stalinist Russia, with all its double-speak hypocrisy, he would have written a worthwhile novel. He did so much more than that in <i>Child 44</i>, a frightening, chilling, almost unbelievable horror story about the very worst that Stalin's henchmen could manage. In this worker's paradise, superior in every way to the decadent West, the citizen's needs are met: health care, food, shelter, security. All one must offer in exchange are work and loyalty to the State. Leo Demidov is a believer, a former war hero who loves his country and wants only to serve it well. He puts contradictions out of his mind and carries on. Until something happens that he cannot ignore. A serial killer of children is on the loose, and the State cannot admit it. <p> To admit that such a murderer is committing these crimes is itself a crime against the State. Instead of coming to terms with it, the State's official position is that it is merely coincidental that children have been found dead, perhaps from accidents near the railroad tracks, perhaps from a person deemed insane, or, worse still, homosexual. But why does each victim have his or her stomach excised, a string around the ankle, and a mouth full of dirt? Coincidence? Leo, in disgrace and exiled to a country village, doesn't think so. How can he prove it when he is being pursued like a common criminal himself? He and his wife, Raisa, set out to find the killer. The revelations that follow are jaw-dropping and the suspense doesn't let up. This is a debut novel worth reading. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>International #1 bestselling author Tom Rob Smith graduated from Cambridge University in 2001 and lives in London.

At the head of the family is the prince, Don Fabrizio. Proud and stubborn, he is accustomed to knowing his own place in the world and expects his household to run accordingly. He is aware of the changes which are rapidly making men historically obsolete but he remains attached to the old ways. His favourite nephew, Tancredi, may be an ardent supporter of Garibaldi and may later marry outside his class, but Don Fabrizio will make few accommodations for the modern world. Containing, for the first time in any language, the full original text, Tomasi di Lampedusa&#39;s classic tale lovingly memorialises the details of a vanishing world while retaining its melancholic and ironic sense of time passing and the frailty of human emotions.</p><p><i>The Leopard</i> is set in Sicily in 1860, as Italian unification is coming violently into being, but it transcends the historical-novel classification. E.M. Forster called it, instead, "a novel which happens to take place in history." Lampedusa's Sicily is a land where each social gesture is freighted with nuance, threat, and nostalgia, and his skeptical protagonist, Don Fabrizio, is uniquely placed to witness all and alter absolutely nothing. Like his creator, the prince is an aristocrat and an astronomer, a man "watching the ruin of his own class and his own inheritance without ever making, still less wanting to make, any move toward saving it." Far better to take refuge in the night skies. <p> What renders <i>The Leopard</i> so beautiful, and so despairing, is Lampedusa's grasp of human frailty and his vision of Sicily's arid terrain--"comfortless and irrational, with no lines that the mind could grasp, conceived apparently in a delirious moment of creation; a sea suddenly petrified at the instant when a change of wind had flung waves into frenzy." Though the author had long had the book in mind, he didn't begin writing it until he was in his late 50s. He died at 60, soon after it was rejected as unpublishable. </p><p> Archibald Colquhoun's lyrical translation also contains 70 more precious pages of Lampedusa--a memoir, a short story, and the first chapter of a novel. In "Places of My Infancy" the author warns that "the reader (who won't exist) must expect to be led meandering through a lost Earthly Paradise. If it bores him. I don't mind." Luckily, the reader does exist; even more luckily, boredom is not an option.</p>A classic of modern fiction. Set in the 1860s, THE LEOPARD is the spellbinding story of a decadent, dying Sicilian aristocracy threatened by the approaching forces of democracy and revolution.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>101 Ways to Do More with Your Dog: Make Your Dog a Superdog with Sports, Games, Exercises, Tricks, Mental Challenges, Crafts, and Bonding</h2><p><p>Play, jump, drive, pull, help, or just soak up the limelight&#x2014;<i>101 Ways to Do More with Your Dog </i>builds confidence and jump starts the bonding process between dog and owner.

Named one of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>'s Best Children's Books of 2014. &nbsp;</b><br><br>There's a murderer on the loose--but that doesn't stop the girls of St. Etheldreda's from attempting to hide the death of their headmistress in this rollicking farce. <br>&nbsp;The students of St. Etheldreda's School for Girls face a bothersome dilemma. Their irascible headmistress, Mrs. Plackett, and her surly brother, Mr. Godding, have been most inconveniently poisoned at Sunday dinner. Now the school will almost certainly be closed and the girls sent home--unless these seven very proper young ladies can hide the murders and convince their neighbors that nothing is wrong. &nbsp;Julie Berry's <i>The Scandalous Sisterhood of Prickwillow Place</i>&nbsp;is a smart, hilarious Victorian romp, full of outrageous plot twists, mistaken identities, and mysterious happenings.</p><p><p><b>Julie Berry</b> has never solved a murder or attended boarding school. Her manners are decidedly improper. But she is part of a scandalous sisterhood. She's the youngest of seven children, six of whom are girls, and if they'd ever had a chance to conceal a corpse and run a school, they'd have jumped on it. Today she lives in eastern Massachusetts with her husband and their four sons and two cats.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Each Sunday afternoon at Saint Etheldreda&#x2019;s School for Young Ladies on Prickwillow Road in Ely, Cambridgeshire, the seven enrolled young ladies were invited by custom to join Headmistress Constance Plackett while she entertained her younger brother, Mr. Aldous Godding, at the dinner table. The privilege of watching the headmistress and her regular Sunday guest consume the veal that they, the young ladies themselves, had prepared, more than compensated for the lack of sufficient veal for all the table to share. The girls had learned to be content with buttered bread and hot beans, Sundays upon end. Such self-denial would serve them well in their future callings as wives. This was Mr. Aldous Godding&#x2019;s firm belief, and his sister, the widow Mrs. Plackett, with years of matrimonial experience behind her, could only agree.</p> <p>On one particular Sunday evening in May, midway through the meal, Mrs. Plackett sopped her plate with her bread, took a bite of it, and let the morsel fall to the floor, whilst her head lolled back upon her shoulders, and her eyes gazed blankly at the ceiling. She shuddered. She shook. She let out a choking cough, then fell silent.</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter, Connie?&#x201d; her brother demanded between mouthfuls. &#x201c;Speak up, woman. It isn&#x2019;t decent goggling about like that. Pass the pepper, Missy.&#x201d; This he addressed to Disgraceful Mary Jane, who sat nearest to him, but he neither knew her name nor the source of her disgrace. All the young ladies were &#x201c;Missy&#x201d; to him.</p> <p>Disgraceful Mary Jane passed the pepper. Mr. Godding used it liberally, ate a bite of veal, laid down his knife and fork, touched his beard with his napkin, and rose from his seat. He made his way around the table to where his sister sat, raised his arm to thump her back, then choked, clutched his throat, fell forward, and landed on the floor with a thud that reverberated up the legs of the chairs upon which the seven young ladies sat.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dead, I imagine,&#x201d; Dour Elinor observed.</p> <p>Smooth Kitty slipped from her chair and went softly to the headmistress&#x2019;s side. She plucked the spectacles off Dull Martha&#x2019;s nose, polished them on her sleeve, then held them in front of Mrs. Plackett&#x2019;s limp mouth. She watched and listened closely. The other girls hung poised for the verdict, their forks frozen in mid-bite.</p> <p>Smooth Kitty, satisfied that no breath had fogged the glasses, nodded and placed them back on Dull Martha&#x2019;s nose. &#x201c;Dead as a kipper,&#x201d; she pronounced.</p> <p>&#x201c;Eugh,&#x201d; Dull Martha sputtered. &#x201c;You made a dead person breathe on my glasses!&#x201d;</p> <p>Pocked Louise opened her mouth to correct Dull Martha, but Smooth Kitty shook her head slightly. Pocked Louise, the youngest of the girls, was accustomed to her older schoolmates bossing her. She kept still.</p> <p>Dear Roberta covered her face with her hands. &#x201c;But this is awful! Hadn&#x2019;t we ought to call Doctor Snelling?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Bit late for that,&#x201d; Dour Elinor responded. &#x201c;Louise. Check the other one.&#x201d;</p> <p>Pocked Louise, the resident scientist, approached the fallen form of Mr. Aldous Godding cautiously. As his face was mashed against the floor, it became clear to her that she must touch him in order to turn him over, a thought which wrinkled her pox-scarred nose into a fright of disgust.</p> <p>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; Dour Elinor urged. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t bite.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But he&#x2019;s a <i>man</i>,&#x201d; Pocked Louise protested. &#x201c;And such a greasy one.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a ninny. Of course he&#x2019;s a man,&#x201d; snorted Disgraceful Mary Jane. &#x201c;Believe me, there are many far better.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Think of him as a specimen in a jar,&#x201d; Smooth Kitty said, &#x201c;specially killed for the purpose of examination.&#x201d;</p> <p>Dear Roberta dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief. &#x201c;Killed?&#x201d; she squeaked. &#x201c;Did you say <i>killed</i>?&#x201d;</p> <p>Pocked Louise by this point had managed to upturn her specimen and proclaim him dead. The gush of blood from his broken nose spread a ghastly crimson all over his already unpleasant face, and threatened to eternally stain the Persian rug. The girls gathered round in a circle, leaning over the body.</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>Killed</i>,&#x201d; Dour Elinor said. &#x201c;<i>Murdered</i>.&#x201d; She savored the <i>R</i>&#x2019;s in her pronunciation: <i>murrrrderrrred</i>.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh. Oh my,&#x201d; Dear Roberta began to gasp. &#x201c;A murder. Oh dear. I think I shall faint.&#x201d; She fluttered her hand before her face.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not now, Roberta, there&#x2019;s a dear,&#x201d; interjected Mary Jane. &#x201c;Why bother swooning when there are no young men about to see you do it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Balderdash,&#x201d; Pocked Louise snorted. &#x201c;If <i>I</i> wanted to faint, which I wouldn&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;d go right ahead and do it. I wouldn&#x2019;t give tuppence for whether or not there were males present.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sturdy stuff, Louise,&#x201d; said Stout Alice. &#x201c;To thine own self be true. Now, if we can return to the matter at hand&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;At foot, you mean,&#x201d; Dull Martha said, glancing at the corpse on the carpet.</p> <p>&#x201c;Something has killed Mrs. Plackett and Mr. Godding.&#x201d; Stout Alice dabbed at the blood spot on the rug with her napkin. &#x201c;But it may have been a mere piece of meat lodged in the throat. We mustn&#x2019;t run away with ourselves with this talk of murder.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The odds of both of them accidentally choking within seconds of each other seem infinitesimally small,&#x201d; sniffed Pocked Louise. &#x201c;The facts suggest poison, which clearly points to murder. Someone murdered them.&#x201d;</p> <p>An angelic smile spread across Smooth Kitty&#x2019;s pretty face. &#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but the question is, who?&#x201d;</p> <p>Silence hung over the dining room. The glass-domed clock on the mantel ticked. Flowered chintz curtains swam in the sweet May breeze. Mrs. Constance Plackett sat forever straight and slack-jawed in her dining chair as seven young ladies each looked at the others as though seeing them for the first time.</p> <p>&#x201c;Surely it couldn&#x2019;t have been one of us,&#x201d; Dear Roberta sniffled.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; said Disgraceful Mary Jane. &#x201c;I say hurrah if it <i>was</i> one of us. Finally someone showed some good sense and got rid of those two.&#x201d;</p> <p>Dear Roberta&#x2019;s eyes filled with tears. &#x201c;But that would be dreadful! How could we go on living here, wondering which one of us was a poisoner?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Grab his feet, won&#x2019;t you, dear?&#x201d; Stout Alice addressed Dull Martha, and bent to lace her arms underneath Mr. Godding&#x2019;s, which seemed now to be made of cement. Dull Martha complied, and the other young ladies pitched in, shifting and sharing the weight as best they could, taking special care to keep blood off their dresses. Together they hoisted their dead headmistress&#x2019;s dead brother up into the air.</p> <p>&#x201c;Now what do we do with him?&#x201d; asked Disgraceful Mary Jane. &#x201c;Dump him on the sofa until the constables arrive? I suppose we&#x2019;d better send someone to fetch them.&#x201d; This thought seemed to please her. &#x201c;Say, I&#x2019;ll go. There&#x2019;s a new constable up from London who&#x2019;s ever so tall, with such lovely square shoulders, and the most adorable little gap between his front teeth. I&#x2019;ll just get my new shawl&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hold a moment,&#x201d; Smooth Kitty said. &#x201c;Before we run off flirting with constables and calling physicians, I say we think carefully. Dear Roberta has asked a very sensible question.&#x201d;</p> <p>Dear Roberta blinked. &#x201c;I have?&#x201d;</p> <p>Stout Alice shifted Mr. Godding&#x2019;s torso uncomfortably. &#x201c;Do you mind if we have our little chat after we&#x2019;ve put Mr. Godding down somewhere?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, just drop him there where he is,&#x201d; said Smooth Kitty. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s beyond help now.&#x201d;</p> <p>For the second time in minutes, Mr. Godding crashed to the floor.</p> <p>&#x201c;Bother,&#x201d; Stout Alice said. &#x201c;Now we&#x2019;ll just have to hoist him up again.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;As I was saying,&#x201d; Smooth Kitty began, then paused. &#x201c;Oh! Check his pockets, will you, Louise?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p> <p>Kitty shrugged. &#x201c;If he&#x2019;s got any money, we&#x2019;ll have better use for it than he will.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Like the Achaeans in the Trojan war,&#x201d; murmured Dour Elinor, with a strange light in her eyes, &#x201c;stripping armor off the bodies of their fallen enemies.&#x201d;</p> <p>Smooth Kitty coughed. &#x201c;Yes. Well. Something like that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t see why <i>I</i> have to do all the dirty work,&#x201d; grumbled Pocked Louise.</p> <p>&#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re the youngest, and we say so,&#x201d; said Disgraceful Mary Jane, earning a kick in the heel from Stout Alice.</p> <p>&#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re so thorough, dear,&#x201d; said Smooth Kitty.</p> <p>Pocked Louise grimaced as she reached two fingers gingerly into each of Mr. Godding&#x2019;s trouser pockets. Her search yielded a cigar, a snuffbox, a coin, a key, and a folded bit of scribbled paper.</p> <p>&#x201c;Is it a note?&#x201d; asked Alice, peering at the scrap. &#x201c;Does it mean something?&#x201d;</p> <p>Louise frowned. &#x201c;More like an inkblot,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Perhaps a triangle. Nothing of interest here.&#x201d; She dropped the items on a table.</p> <p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t call a sovereign a thing of interest?&#x201d; Smooth Kitty, ever one for figures and ledgers, nabbed the coin, then reported on their headmistress&#x2019;s pockets. &#x201c;Mrs. Plackett has a sovereign, a few shillings and pence, a handkerchief, and mint pastilles.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Would to heaven she&#x2019;d used the pastilles more often,&#x201d; said Disgraceful Mary Jane.</p> <p>&#x201c;Mary Jane!&#x201d; Dear Roberta cried. &#x201c;To speak so of the departed!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, she had foul breath, dead or alive,&#x201d; Mary Jane replied. &#x201c;Her odors won&#x2019;t improve from here on out.&#x201d;</p> <p>Smooth Kitty gathered what change they&#x2019;d found in both sets of pockets and slipped it into her own. Then she gathered the other small items and dropped them into a small crockery urn on the sideboard.</p> <p>&#x201c;As I was <i>saying</i>.&#x201d; Kitty resumed her original query with a touch of exasperation in her voice. &#x201c;What Roberta so wisely asked, several moments ago, was, &#x2018;How shall we go on living here?&#x2019; She has a point. Once we notify constables and so forth, we&#x2019;ll all be sent home.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course we&#x2019;ll be sent home,&#x201d; Dear Roberta said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the only logical thing.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;I suppose I must learn to love Stepmother somehow. It was so much easier here when I didn&#x2019;t have to look at her. It made it much easier to pray for her, as the vicar said we must do for all our enemies.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But why, Roberta dear?&#x201d; Dull Martha said. &#x201c;Why should you go home to your nasty stepmother? Can&#x2019;t we stay here, and we&#x2019;ll all just go on like we do?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t let us,&#x201d; Pocked Louise protested.</p> <p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s they?&#x201d; Dull Martha asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Coroners,&#x201d; Dour Elinor intoned. &#x201c;Undertakers. Police. School overseers. All the people who&#x2019;ll descend upon us like a flock of ravens once it&#x2019;s known that these two are dead.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You sound almost glad of their coming, Elinor,&#x201d; Smooth Kitty observed.</p> <p>&#x201c;Only the undertakers,&#x201d; Elinor admitted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always wanted to witness an embalming.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Bother and more bother.&#x201d; Disgraceful Mary Jane flopped back into her chair at the dinner table. &#x201c;With those two nuisances gone, we might actually have had some fun. This whole place is suddenly <i>much</i> more interesting. And now we shall have to leave it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And each other,&#x201d; Pocked Louise added.</p> <p>Stout Alice put an arm around Pocked Louise. Louise rested her head on Alice&#x2019;s shoulder.</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to go home, either,&#x201d; Dull Martha said. &#x201c;My little brothers torment me so. They pull my hair and stick it in ink, and paste my piano pages together.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mother won&#x2019;t let me out of her sight for a minute,&#x201d; Disgraceful Mary Jane said. &#x201c;She swears I&#x2019;ll elope if she leaves me unguarded for half an hour. I ask you, have you ever heard such rubbish?&#x201d; She grinned. &#x201c;Ten minutes and a willing man are all I&#x2019;d need.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve never had a shortage of willing men,&#x201d; Smooth Kitty said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Correct, but under Mother&#x2019;s watch, there&#x2019;s an absolute dearth of minutes.&#x201d;</p> <p>Stout Alice was uninterested in Mary Jane&#x2019;s chances for hasty marriage. &#x201c;If I go home, all I shall hear from Grandmamma is how fat I am compared to Cousin Isabelle,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;<i>She</i> should talk. It takes two maids to tie Grandmamma&#x2019;s corsets, but that doesn&#x2019;t stop her from goading me.&#x201d;</p> <p>Dour Elinor stared at the black coals on the grate. &#x201c;My mother will tell me all day long that a young lady should radiate <i>sweetness</i> and <i>good cheer</i>.&#x201d; She spoke the words the way others might pronounce <i>maggots</i> and <i>black rot</i>.</p> <p>Smooth Kitty clucked a sympathetic tongue for poor Elinor.</p> <p>&#x201c;I suppose they&#x2019;ll find other schools for us eventually,&#x201d; Pocked Louise said. &#x201c;New mistresses, new nasty girls to make us miserable.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We have all gotten along so beautifully here.&#x201d; Dear Roberta sighed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s something of a miracle, really. We aren&#x2019;t simply boarding-school mates. We&#x2019;re like a family.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re better than family,&#x201d; Disgraceful Mary Jane corrected. &#x201c;Families are full of aunts and brothers and parents. We&#x2019;re <i>sisters.</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I always wished for a sister,&#x201d; Dull Martha said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; said Dear Roberta.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not me,&#x201d; Dour Elinor confessed. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t mind your company.&#x201d;</p> <p>Pocked Louise sat up. &#x201c;None of us here has a sister at home, have we?&#x201d; she said slowly. &#x201c;I never realized that before. Not a single one of us.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I hate to leave.&#x201d; Dear Roberta had begun to cry. &#x201c;We have our own sisterhood.&#x201d;</p> <p>Elinor handed Roberta a black silk handkerchief.</p> <p>&#x201c;You want to know what I say?&#x201d; Smooth Kitty asked no one in particular. &#x201c;<i>I</i> say we don&#x2019;t tell these&nbsp;&#x2026; ravens and what-do-you-call-ems&nbsp;&#x2026; coroners. Let&#x2019;s not tell <i>anyone.</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>They stared at each other. Smoldering coal settled in the fireplace, sending up low sparks. Each girl was alone, for a moment, with her private amazement. Smooth Kitty counted her heartbeats as she waited for their responses.</p> <p>&#x201c;But the bodies will smell,&#x201d; Dull Martha said at length. &#x201c;Sooner or later they&#x2019;re bound to.&#x201d;</p> <p>Disgraceful Mary Jane, whose green eyes had lit up wonderfully at Smooth Kitty&#x2019;s suggestion, gave Dull Martha a little rub on the back. &#x201c;No, darling, they won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll bury them. Right in the vegetable beds.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll make a lovely compost,&#x201d; Pocked Louise added. &#x201c;Perhaps not so much this season. But next season the marrows and squashes will burst with juicy goodness.&#x201d; She scratched her nose thoughtfully. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll just have to be careful this fall when we go digging for potatoes.&#x201d;</p> <p>Smooth Kitty&#x2019;s eyes darted from young lady to young lady, watching to see how well her idea had taken hold. She didn&#x2019;t dare congratulate herself yet. She must be sure where they stood.</p> <p>&#x201c;Never mind potatoes. There&#x2019;ll be a scandal,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;An investigation. Each one of us could be under a cloud of suspicion for the rest of our lives.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A <i>black spot</i>,&#x201d; Dour Elinor intoned. &#x201c;A blemish upon our maiden purity.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, no, surely not,&#x201d; Disgraceful Mary Jane replied. &#x201c;Not for such a trifling thing as neglecting to mention the death of a headmistress and her nasty brother. No one could really be upset over that. It takes much more fun to leave a blemish upon one&#x2019;s maiden purity.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll think one of us murdered them,&#x201d; Pocked Louise warned.</p> <p>Smooth Kitty slipped an arm through Louise&#x2019;s elbow. &#x201c;What I&#x2019;d like to know, love, is whether or not one of us actually did.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Text copyright � 2014 by Julie Berry</p></p><h2>Nutrition 101 : Choose Life a Family Nutrition and Health Program</h2><p>Nutrition 101: Choose Life! is a three-in-one family nutrition and health program for all ages that presents the major body systems, how they function, their common health issues, the benefits of good food and the consequences of bad food.

Michener has taken on the establishment of modern-day South Africa and, in this bold and boisterous novel, made it his own. In this epic tale of struggle and adventure, peopled with missionaries, tribesmen, adventurers and scoundrels, we learn of the sweeping passions and intense rivalries that play an important part in the development of a flourishing empire. From the Java-born Van Dooms, whose descendants become the first Treknoers and Afrikaners, to the Nxumalos, who help to forge the powerful Zulu nation -- this is a stow of love and loyalty, cruelty and betrayal, adventure and heroism, from the mind of a master storyteller.<br><br>Look for other titles by James A.

As a boy, he came here legally with his family. Together they left Santo Domingo behind, but life in New York City was harder than they imagined. Their visas lapsed, and Dan-el&#x2019;s father returned home. But Dan-el&#x2019;s courageous mother was determined to make a better life for her bright sons.<br><br>Without papers, she faced tremendous obstacles. While Dan-el was only in grade school, the family joined the ranks of the city&#x2019;s homeless. Dan-el, his mother, and brother lived in a downtown shelter where Dan-el&#x2019;s only refuge was the meager library. There he met Jeff, a young volunteer from a wealthy family. Jeff was immediately struck by Dan-el&#x2019;s passion for books and learning. With Jeff&#x2019;s help, Dan-el was accepted on scholarship to Collegiate, the oldest private school in the country.<br><br>There, Dan-el thrived. Throughout his youth, Dan-el navigated these two worlds: the rough streets of East Harlem, where he lived with his brother and his mother and tried to make friends, and the ultra-elite halls of a Manhattan private school, where he could immerse himself in a world of books and where he soon rose to the top of his class.<br><br>From Collegiate, Dan-el went to Princeton, where he thrived, and where he made the momentous decision to come out as an undocumented student in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> profile a few months before he gave the salutatorian&#x2019;s traditional address in Latin at his commencement.<br><br><i>Undocumented</i> is a classic story of the triumph of the human spirit. It also is the perfect cri de coeur for the debate on comprehensive immigration reform.<br><br><b>Praise for&nbsp;<i>Undocumented</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Dan-el Padilla Peralta&#x2019;s story is as compulsively readable as a novel, an all-American tall tale that just happens to be true. From homeless shelter to Princeton, Oxford, and Stanford, through the grace not only of his own hard work but his mother&#x2019;s discipline and care, he documents the America we should still aspire to be.&#x201d; &#x2014;Dr. Anne-Marie Slaughter, President of the New America Foundation</p><p>Born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, DAN-EL PADILLA PERALTA came to the United States with his family at the age of four.

He received his MPhil from the University of Oxford and his PhD in classics from Stanford University. He is currently a Mellon Research Fellow at Columbia University.&#x201c;Dan-el, the police just searched our apartment for drugs!&#x201d;<br><br>I took Mom&#x2019;s call outside my school&#x2019;s com�puter room, where I&#x2019;d been proofreading the school newspaper.<br><br>&#x201c;What? What happened? Why did they think we had drugs? Did they say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mi&#x2019;jo, it&#x2019;s going to be OK now. They made a big mistake. They had one cop who speaks a little Spanish explain to me what went wrong. They&#x2019;d received a call from someone who told them dealers were storing drugs in an apartment in our building. The cops thought the informant said &#x2018;Apartment 2B,&#x2019; so they came to our apartment&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So they were there when you got home from church?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;d knocked down the door. They were searching every�thing. They searched my bedroom, the table where I have the candles for the santos, the living room, the kitchen, the bedrooms.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do they still think we&#x2019;re involved with drug dealers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ay, no, mi&#x2019;jo. So they&#x2019;re searching everywhere and I&#x2019;m telling them over and over again that they&#x2019;re wrong, that we&#x2019;re a family of God and I&#x2019;m just a single mother raising two children. I showed them all your books, I told them you go to a famous private school on full scholarship. But they wouldn&#x2019;t believe anything I told them. They just kept asking where the drugs were. But finally, finally, thank you, Virgin Mary, one of the police officers took out his radio and spoke with the police officers standing outside our building. That&#x2019;s when another cop came up to me and said they were extremely sorry. That it had all been a mistake, that they were supposed to be inves�tigating another apartment instead. And you should have seen them, Dan-el, how nice they were when they realized their mistake. They&#x2019;re even going to pay to have our door fixed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Those sinverg�enza cops!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dan-el! They were doing their job, my son. It&#x2019;s over now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did they ask about our immi�gration status?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank God no, my son. They didn&#x2019;t ask me for papeles or anything like that.&#x201d;<br><br>I let out a small sigh of relief. Mom continued:<br><br>&#x201c;But I must have interrupted you, my son, you&#x2019;re still at school working on the newspaper, right? Everything&#x2019;s OK, I just wanted you to know what had happened. Get back to what you were doing and I&#x2019;ll see you at home for dinner. Dios te bendiga.&#x201d;<br><br>I returned to the computer room.

The full extent of Sage's talent is laid bare in this stunning slip-cased book that includes many works that have not been viewed publicly since the 1940s and 1950s. An insightful essay explores Sage's involvement with the Surrealists and her marriage to Tanguy, as a partner and sounding board. A generously illustrated chronology includes personal and archival material that reveals much about her life and practice. The paintings, collages, and works on paper--haunting, evocative, and original--are reproduced to full effect, each with comprehensive provenance and exhibition history.

He marshals the forces of his infamous arsenal: his language, his wit, and his intolerance for suffering fools to review, consider, and in some cases, condemn. He takes to task the best and the brightest, including Cervantes and Milton, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, and Norman Mailer and Elmore Leonard. From "Great Books" to "Some American Prose," from "Popularity Contest" to the "Ultramundane," Amis parses the classics and the unconventional with the subversive brilliance he brings to everything he touches.<p>He also skewers myths about masculinity, with great skepticism and more than a dash of nose-thumbing humor. Unflinchingly, he lambastes the "supercharged banality" of Elvis, the monumentally self-absorption of Andy Warhol, and American squeamishness about movie violence. Evaluating the present participle, casting a cold eye on the Guinness Book of Records, and the sacrosanct image of Abraham Lincoln, Amis astutely surveys our cultural landscape and fluctuates between celebration and castigation, with the precision of a hypodermic.</p></p><p>In Martin Amis's <i>War Against Clich�</i>, a selection of critical essays and reviews published between 1971 and 2000, he establishes himself as one of the fiercest critics and commentators on the literature and culture of the late 20th century. (He has already established himself as one of the most controversial and original novelists writing in English with novels such as <i>Money</i> and <i>Time's Arrow</i>.) In his foreword to the book Amis ruefully admits that his earlier reviews reveal a rather humorless attitude towards the "Literature and Society" debate of the time. Yet this only adds to the fascination of the collection, as Amis gradually finds his critical voice in the 1980s, confirming his passionate belief that "all writing is a campaign against clich�." <p> In the subsequent sections of the book, this war leads to some wonderfully cutting and amusing responses to whatever crosses his path, from books on chess and nuclear proliferation to Cervantes' <i>Don Quixote</i> and the novels of his hero Vladimir Nabokov. Praise for his literary heroes is often fulsome: J.G. Ballard's <i>High-Rise</i> "is an intense and vivid bestiary, which lingers in the mind and chronically disquiets it." But his literary wrath is also devastating in its incisiveness: Thomas Harris's <i>Hannibal</i> is dismissed as "a novel of such profound and virtuoso vulgarity," while John Fowles is attacked because "he sweetens the pill: but the pill was saccharine all along." Often frank in its reappraisals (Amis concedes to being too hard on Ballard's <i>Crash</i> when reviewing the film many years later), some of the best writing is reserved for his journalism on sex manuals, chess, and his beloved football. <i>The War Against Clich�</i> will provoke strong reactions, but that only seems to confirm, rather than deny, the value of Amis's writing. <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Is there "anything that Martin Amis can't write about? In this virtuosic, career-spanning collection he takes on James Joyce and Elvis Presley, Nabokov and English football, Jane Austen and "Penthouse Forum, William Burroughs and Hillary Clinton. But above all, Amis is concerned with literature, and with the deadly cliches-not only of the pen, but of the mind and the heart. <br>In The War Against Cliche," Amis serves up fresh assessments of the classics and plucks neglected masterpieces off their dusty shelves. He tilts with Cervantes, Dickens and Milton, celebrates Bellow, Updike and Elmore Leonard, and deflates some of the most bloated reputations of the past three decades. On every page Amis writes with jaw-dropping felicity, wit, and a subversive brilliance that sheds new light on everything he touches.</p><h2>Chemistry Problems and Solutions Student Edition</h2><p>Chemistry Problems and Solutions guide</p><p></p><h2>The Great and Terrible, Volume 6: Clear As the Moon</h2><p>The nuclear explosion over Washington D.C. and the subsequent EMP attack have left a decapitated government and 300 million helpless citizens.

Contrary to what its name implies, Coromandel lacquer does not come from this region but from China. Although almost all museums with a major Oriental art collection own a Coromandel screen, no monograph has so far been dedicated to that theme. This is the first book to directly address this subject. Aimed at a public with an interest in Oriental art, this book is divided into four parts. The first part gives a brief overview of trade relations between East and West. In order to place the emergence of Coromandel screen in its proper context, the first part also details the evolution of Chinese lacquer. The second part deals with the origin of Coromandel lacquer technique and the third part describes the various decorative patterns to be found in the screens featured in the book. By comparing the style of the dated screens with that of undated ones, the authors have formed a theory of how the Coromandel style developed. Part four includes a research into the materials and techniques used in the manufacture of a Coromandel screen. Here old Chinese texts on lacquer techniques are consulted and fragments of Coromandel lacquer are examined. <p>This book provides the first step toward broader and deeper research on the subject and should encourage more discussions on the subject. It will become one of the classic references that breaks new ground in this much-neglected subject.</p></p><p></p><h2>Tales From the Dark Continent</h2><p>Essays.

How does something as nonmaterial as consciousness arise from something material like the brain? Dr. Diane Powell, a Johns Hopkins&#x2013;trained neuroscientist, has brilliantly reassessed the meaning and nature of consciousness by exploring research on the workings of psychic phenomena. </p><p>Over the past few decades several well-designed and rigorously supervised experiments have documented the existence of telepathic interconnection, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis, and out-of-body experiences. Mainstream science has largely ignored these data because they all defy the traditional model of consciousness as being solely the product of brain chemistry. </p><p>Building from these experiments, Powell constructs a new theory of consciousness. I ntegrating concepts from physics, neuroscience, and other disciplines, she offers an insightful and intriguing explanation of ESP, provocatively claiming that the existence of psychic abilities expands our understanding and appreciation of consciousness. Psychic abilities are also consistent with findings in modern physics: For example, psychokinesis implies that consciousness is a type of force field, while precognition suggests that the past, present, and future exist concurrently. </p><p>Eye-opening in its conclusions and exciting in its implications, <i>The ESP Enigma </i>will challenge your preconceived notions and expand your mind.</p></p><p><p><b>Diane Hennacy Powell, M.D.</b>, completed her training in medicine, neurology, and psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She is a former member of Harvard Medical School's faculty and of a part-time think tank on consciousness at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, and has published articles in neuroscience and neuropsychiatry journals. She lives in Medford, Oregon, and Los Angeles, California.</p><p>&#x201c;In her new book <i>The ESP Enigma: The Scientific Case for Psychic Phenomena</i>, former Harvard professor Diane Hennacy Powell combines philosophy, physics, and empirical data to examine supernatural traits like telepathy (the ability to access someone else's consciousness), psychokinesis (the ability to use one's consciousness to affect external objects), clairvoyance (the ability to broaden one's consciousness to remote time and space) and precognition (the ability to see into the future).&#x201d; &#x2015;Time Magazine</p><p>&#x201c;A cogent argument offering many striking examples of the power and potential of the unconscious...human history is rich with mythology about extrasensory perception, most famously employed by the seers at the ancient oracle of Delphi, but its relationship to the brain remains unexplained. Is consciousness a surrounding force that we are capable of tapping into, or is it a result of the billions of synapse connections occurring in our brains? Can mere coincidence explain the vast number of Jung's "synchronicities," or is consciousness a virtual medium for universal interconnectivity? Powell's theory of consciousness seeks to resolve some of these mysteries. Einstein and Hawking, she reminds us, wrote about time being malleable, existing totally and simultaneously. This would explain prescient visions and telepathic instinct shared by loved ones during crises even when they're located far from each other. In easy-to-understand language, the author describes carefully controlled studies involving telekinesis, clairvoyance and precognition, presenting the results as evidence of the brain's latent psychic tendency. She also theorizes that dreams, near-death experiences and out-of-body sensations may be manifestations of our inherent ability to relax the constructs of three-dimensional perception. Perhaps even memory is an instance of our minds accessing outside psychic information from "all of space and time." Powell dubs this intertwined, inextricable relationship between the individual's internal world and the external world "the Mobius mind," named for its cyclical and symbiotic nature. This concept persists in Eastern religions, particularly Buddhism; meditation is one technique to reach a state of collective enlightenment. Particle physics, too, relies on underlying theories of resonance and symmetry, notes the author. She makes a persuasive argument that with the spectacular advances in particle physics will come a scientific revolution of thought, and with it a deeper understanding of the brain. Phenomenal brain abnormalities, such as the unexplained expertise of the savant, demonstrate incredible feats of brainpower that can't be described or explained.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>KIRKUS REVIEWS</i></p><p>&#x201c;Psychic power has had trouble gaining scientific respectability, but Powell makes a game effort to propose serious consideration of its existence.... Incorporating Powell's knowledge of neuroscience, this work should appeal to those open to the idea that ESP exists.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>BOOKLIST</i></p></p><h2>Buffalo Nation: History and Legend of the North American Bison</h2><p>Looks at the role of the buffalo in the culture of the Plains Indians, and traces the successful efforts to prevent the buffalo&#39;s extinction</p><p>This remarkable examination of the history and cultural impact of an animal species nearly lost for good uses a wide variety of sources in tracing the buffalo from the Ice Age to the present. Geist describes the historic adaptations that occurred in various classes of buffalo, the biology of the North American bison, the impact of human hunters, and the close relationship that developed between bison and Native American tribes. The slaughter of the great herds that began in the mid^-nineteenth century is truly horrifying today, and many people at the time were also sickened by it. Geist convincingly shows that this near extinction was the result of government efforts to deprive Native American tribes of food, forcing them onto reservations and opening the West to settlers. Sprinkled throughout are buffalo myths and stories. A fine history made even better by the array of drawings and stunning full-color photos. <i>Brian McCombie</i>"Fascinating and authoritative . . . Geist skillfully interweaves this scientific narrative with Native American buffalo myths and U.S. policies to exterminate the animals." -- <i>Outdoor Life</i><br><br>"Interesting and worth reading. . . .

But most people still shun disorder-or suffer guilt over the mess they can&#39;t avoid. No longer!With a spectacular array of true stories and case studies of the hidden benefits of mess,A Perfect Mess overturns the accepted wisdom that tight schedules, organization, neatness, and consistency are the keys to success. Drawing on examples from business, parenting, cooking, the war on terrorism, retail, and even the meteoric career of Arnold Schwarzenegger, coauthors Abrahmson and Freedman demonstrate that moderately messy systems use resources more efficiently, yield better solutions, and are harder to break than neat ones.Applying this idea on scales both large (government, society) and small (desktops, garages), A Perfect Mess uncovers all the ways messiness can trump neatness, and will help you assess the right amount of disorder for any system. Whether it&#39;s your company&#39;s management plan or your hallway closet that bedevils you, this book will show you why to say yes to mess.</p><p>David H. Freedman is the author of three books, and is a business and science journalist who has written for The Atlantic Monthly, Newsweek, and Wired, among others. He lives in Massachusetts.Is your workspace a complex but personal jumble of information, data, and stuff? Is your home a comfortable space that has some black holes of organization? Then you may be on the track to greater productivity, creativity, and happiness, according to the authors. Reader David Freedman makes this a friendly listen as the authors reveal such details as the possibility that the discovery of penicillin would not have occurred if the lab had not been a mess. The authors find an order in apparent chaos that they believe is efficient in its own right. This is a good audiobook to listen to when driving or working around the mess, er, house.

That peace was challenged when rival Indian trives threatened war, and ruthless white men, hoping to exploit the tensions, kidnapped a settler&#39;s beautiful daughter. Only Kin Sackett and his brother Yance dared to make the treacherous journey along the Warrior&#39;s Path to rescue the girl from her captors. For when there is a crisis on the frontier you could count on a Sackett for swift action.Filled with exciting tales of the frontier, the chronicle of the Sackett family is perhaps the crowning achievement of one of our greatest storytellers. In The Warrior's Path L'Amour tells the story of Yance and Kin Sackett, two brothers who are the last hope of a young woman who faces a fate worse than death.... <br>When Yance Sackett's sister-in-law is kidnapped, Yance and his brother Kin race north from Carolina to find her. They arrive at a superstitious town rife with rumors -- and learn that someone very powerful was behind Diana's disappearance. <br>To bring the culprit to justice, one brother must sail to the exotic West Indies. There, among pirates, cutthroats, and ruthless "businessmen," he will apply the skills he learned as a frontiersman to an unfamiliar world ... a world where one false move means instant death.</p><h2>Illustrated Handbook of the Bach Flower Remedies</h2><p>An in-depth explanation of an amazing healing system, with remedies for the practitioner.<br><br>Discovered by Dr Edward Bach in the 1930s, the thirty-eight Bach Flower Remedies form a system of healing for the negative emotions and attitudes that can interfere with health and happiness.<br><br>This attractively illustrated book provides a detailed description of each remedy, together with case histories relating to each one to help the reader appreciate how they may be put into practice. The descriptions and cases have been compiled from the Bach Remedy Newsletter, originally edited by Nora Weeks, Dr Bach&#x2019;s successor and close companion. In each issue she featured a remedy along with a collection of her own case notes, and because they represent such an authoritative text, Philip Chancellor, with her blessing has compiled them to create this book.</p><p>Charles William Daniel (1871-1955) was a maverick free-thinker whose tiny publishing house had august links with many of the most influential thinkers and movements of the 20th century. To wit, copies of Daniel&#39;s books could be found in the library at Ghandi&#39;s ashram. This spirit lived on after his death, and the company maintained its niche by publishing definitive texts on a variety of spiritual and esoteric subjects. Many of these titles, notably those on Aromatherapy and Bach Flower remedies, have become standard works on the subject. When the C.W. Daniel list went looking for a new home, the Vermilion and Rider imprints were the natural place for this wonderful collection of authors.Philip M.

Here he describes important developments in theatre from the last century, as well as smaller scale events, from productions by Stanislavsky to the rise of Method Acting, from Brecht&#39;s revolutionary alienation technique to the free form Happenings of the 1960s, and from the different styles of such great Shakespearean actors as John Gielgud and Paul Scofield to a joyous impromptu performance in the burnt-out shell of the Hamburg Opera just after the war. Passionate, unconventional and fascinating, his book shows how theatre defies rules, builds and shatters illusions and creates lasting memories for its audiences.

Cofounder of the Royal Shakespeare Company and director of the International Center for Theater Research in Paris, perhaps Brook's greatest legacy will be <i>The Empty Space</i>. His 1968 book divides the theatrical landscape, as Brook saw it, into four different types: the Deadly Theater (the conventional theater, formulaic and unsatisfying), the Holy Theater (which seeks to rediscover ritual and drama's spiritual dimension, best expressed by the writings of Artaud and the work of director Jerzy Grotowski), the Rough Theater (a theater of the people, against pretension and full of noise and action, best typified by the Elizabethan theater), and the Immediate Theater, which Brook identifies his own career with, an attempt to discover a fluid and ever-changing style that emphasizes the joy of the theatrical experience. What differentiates Brook's writing from so many other theatrical gurus is its extraordinary clarity. His gentle illumination of the four types of theater is conversational, even chatty, and though passionately felt, it's entirely lacking in the sort of didactic bombast that flaws many similar texts. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i>Peter Stephen Paul Brook CH CBE (born 21 March 1925) is a highly influential British theatrical producer and director.

Escaping a possible death sentence, he was sent to St. Elizabeths Hospital near Washington, D.C., where he was held for more than a decade.</p><p>At the hospital, Pound was at his most infamous, and most contradictory. He was a genius and a traitor, a great poet and a madman. He was also an irresistible figure and, in his cell on Chestnut Ward and on the elegant hospital grounds, he was visited by the major poets and writers of his time. T. S. Eliot, Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Charles Olson, and Frederick Seidel all went to sit with him. They listened to him speak and wrote of what they had seen. This was perhaps the world&#x2019;s most unorthodox literary salon: convened by a fascist, held in a lunatic asylum, with chocolate brownies and mayonnaise sandwiches served for tea.</p><p>Pound continues to divide all who read and think of him. At the hospital, the doctors who studied him and the poets who learned from him each had a different understanding of this wild and most difficult man. Tracing Pound through the eyes of his visitors, Daniel Swift&#x2019;s <i>The Bughouse </i>tells a story of politics, madness, and modern art in the twentieth century.</p></p><p><b>Daniel Swift</b> teaches at the New College of the Humanities in London. His first book, <i>Bomber County</i>, was long-listed for the Samuel Johnson Prize and the Guardian First Book Award, and his essays and reviews have appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>New Statesman</i>, and <i>Harper&#x2019;s Magazine</i>.<p>&#x201c;This story of Pound's politics and his prejudices takes on fresh significance...Swift is an alert and eloquent guide...I guarantee that <i>The Bughouse</i> will vex you into thinking more deeply about the relation between an artist's life and work, and perhaps even about the old-fashioned question of moral responsibility.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Maureen Corrigan, NPR's <i>Fresh Air</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;[<i>The Bughouse</i>] abounds in striking details.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>"Engrossing . . . immensely fascinating." &#x2015;<b>Diego Baez, <i>Booklist</i></b></p><p>"A sensitive investigation into the enigmatic, prodigious mind of poet Ezra Pound . . .

It has made my love of Pound far more difficult&#x2015;as it should." <b>&#x2015;Edmund de Waal</b></p><p>"'Pound,' he quipped of his name, 'an enclosure for stray animals.' Swift tells the stories of six poets (although there were many more) who were gathered by Uncle Ez into his pen at St. Elizabeths. Hospitalized Pound here emerges as the uncanny figure of the <i>hospes</i>, at once stranger, guest, and host, at once a welcoming organism and a dangerous, parasitical virus." <b>&#x2015;Richard Sieburth, author of <i>Instigations: Ezra Pound and Remy de Gourmont</i></b></p><p>"To understand an artist as compromised by circumstances&#x2015;and by his own many contradictions&#x2015;as Ezra Pound, we have to trace a complex path through a maze of half-truths, myth, and simplification. <i>The Bughouse </i>does so with supreme care, critical acumen, and humanity, shedding a whole new light not only on Pound the man, but also on the shape and character of <i>The Cantos</i>, one of the most seriously flawed and truly brilliant artworks of the twentieth century." <b>&#x2015;John Burnside</b></p><p>&#x201c;A wonderful portrait of Ezra Pound in all his moods&#x2015;mad, bad, and blindingly sane.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;A.

(Well, maybe readers who remember <i>The Selling of the President</i> back in 1968.) Even those who have no interest in soccer--the majority of Americans, he ruefully admits--will relish the author's vivid account of a team from Castel di Sangro, a tiny town in Italy's poorest region, that against all expectations made it to the national competition. Whether he's chronicling his ordeal at possibly the least-inviting hotel in Italy (the heat doesn't come on until October, no matter the temperature; he is assigned to a room up four flights of stairs though there are no other guests), or sketching a colorful cast of characters that includes the team's sinister owner and an utterly unflappable translator, McGinniss prompts roars of laughter as he reveals an Italy tourists never see. He also saddens readers with a shocking final scene in which he confronts the nation's casual corruption, which taints men he's come to respect and even love. Although not a conventional memoir, this stirring book reveals as much about the author's passionate character as about the nation and the players who win his heart, then break it. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Master storyteller Joe McGinniss travels to Italy to cover the unlikely success of a ragtag minor league soccer team -- and delivers a brilliant and utterly unforgettable story of life in an off-the-beaten-track Italian village.<p>When Joe McGinniss sets out for the remote Italian village of Castel di Sangro in the summer of 1996, he merely wants to spend a season with the village's soccer team, which only weeks before had, miraculously, reached the second-highest-ranking professional league in the land. But soon he finds himself embroiled with an absurd yet irresistible cast of characters, including the team's owner, described by the New York Times as "straight out of a Mario Puzo novel, smoking huge cigars and trailed by bodyguards", and coach Osvaldo Jaconi, whose only English word is the one he uses to describe himself: "bulldozer".</p><p>As the riotous, edge-of-your-seat season unfolds, so, too, does McGinniss's transformation into a true Italian soccer fan, complete with the irrational and blinding passions for which such fans are known. Moreover his fervor for soccer intertwines and grows with his love for the courageous team, their village and its people, and their country. As McGinniss travels with the miracle team on the season-long tour that takes him from the isolated mountain region where Castel di Sangro is located to such gritty towns as Foggia and Cosenza, as well as to obscure nooks of such grand cities as Genoa, Venice, and Verona, he introduces us to an Italy that no tourist guidebook has ever described. The Miracle of Castel di Sangro is a spellbinding, true story of an Italy to savor.</p></p><h2>The Price of Freedom: A Story of Courage and Faith in the Face of Danger</h2><p>Determined to escape to freedom, Simon and Wesley faced danger and hardship fleeing from Romania to Italy. But their nightmare began in earnest when they crawled into a container full of ceramic tiles that was headed across the ocean. Baking in the heat for days in a shipyard, surviving a tremendous storm at sea, suffering from lack of oxygen, and then the agony of thirst, Simon and Wesley both came close to death. The Price of Freedom is the miraculous story of how two young men cling to their faith in God, as they struggled to stay alive against all odds.</p><p></p><h2>Snow Drop, Book 1</h2><p>Hae-Gi and So-Na love each other, but their relationship faces many difficulties, mostly related to the hatred So-Na&#39;s rich father feels towards Hae-Gi&#39;s poor family, and a terrible past that they share.</p><p>A tragic manwha with mature themes about two star-crossed teens that fall madly in love a la Romeo and Juliet, this lovely book from TOKYOPOP is sure to please our shoujo-included readers. <br>-- Newtype USAHooked on The O.C.?

This book is a celebration of women in their various roles: mother, sister, civil rights advocate, consumer advocate, first-class mechanic, politician&#x2014;which Roberts&#x2019; own mother once was.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<em>Washington Post</em> </p><p>&#x201c;The perfect combination of powerful feelings and a modulated style.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014; <em>Los Angeles Times</em> </p><p>From the much beloved Cokie Roberts comes a revised and expanded tenth-anniversary paperback edition of the #1 <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller <em>We Are Our Mothers&#x2019; Daughters</em>&#x2014;complete with new profiles.</p></p><p>Like any journalist worth her salt, renowned news correspondent Cokie Roberts knows how to ask the tough questions. In <i>We Are Our Mothers' Daughters</i>, she poses what has long been a real doozy: "What is woman's place?" As you might guess, her answer is manifold, reflected by the table of contents, which reads like the Career Day schedule at a progressive girls' school: Sister, Politician, Consumer Advocate, Aunt, Soldier, First Class Mechanic, Friend, Reporter, Civil Rights Activist, Wife, Mother/Daughter, Enterpriser. Roberts makes no claims about this being groundbreaking research, or even an exacting investigation, rather, she explains that these are simply her own stories, and those of women she has come in contact with at different times and places in her life.<p> Having graduated from Wellesley College in 1964, Roberts explains that the women of her generation were pioneers in many ways--especially when it came to career and workplace issues: "We were the first women at almost everything we did, and most of us often had the experience of being the only woman in the room." Accordingly, many of her essays are political in nature: the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (which included "sex" as a prohibited discrimination category by virtual accident); the work of consumer advocate Esther Peterson; and the history of women in the military. But for Roberts, it's clear that the personal is political, and many stories, while not overtly activist--her older sister's death, her circle of female friends, and her experiences as a wife, mother, and reporter--reveal the importance she places on a united community of strong women. Using clean, compelling language throughout, Roberts compiles these different stories to reveal a thread of continuity running through the fabric of women, summarizing, "We are connected throughout time and regardless of place." She ends with a message of encouragement for young women--that we need only look as far as our foremothers for inspiration. <i>--Brangien Davis, Amazon.com Kids Editor</i></p>Renowned news correspondent, Cokie Roberts, explores significant issues confronting women on the cusp of the new millennium, such as the balance of work and family, the diverse roles of women, and the connection and distinction between different generations of women. She addresses these critical topics through the lens of her reporting career, melding her personal experiences with the experiences of other exceptional women she has met. <p>Sensitive, straightforward, and perceptive, We Are Our Mothers' Daughters celebrates the diversity of choices and perspectives available to the women of today, but ultimately affirms a bond of female solidarity -- a vital, powerful interconnection among all women, whatever their background. It's an important message, delivered by one of America's most respected and eloquent journalists.</p></p><h2>In the Long Run We Are All Dead: Keynesianism, Political Economy, and Revolution</h2><p><b>A groundbreaking debunking of moderate attempts to resolve financial crises</b><br><br>In the ruins of the 2007&#x2013;2008 financial crisis, self-proclaimed progressives the world over clamored to resurrect the economic theory of John Maynard Keynes. The crisis seemed to expose the disaster of small-state, free-market liberalization and deregulation. Keynesian political economy, in contrast, could put the state back at the heart of the economy and arm it with the knowledge needed to rescue us. But what it was supposed to rescue us from was not so clear. Was it the end of capitalism or the end of the world? For Keynesianism, the answer is both. Keynesians are not and never have been out to save capitalism, but rather to save civilization from itself. It is political economy, they promise, for the world in which we actually live: a world in which prices are &#x201c;sticky,&#x201d; information is &#x201c;asymmetrical,&#x201d; and uncertainty inescapable. In this world, things will definitely not take care of themselves in the long run. Poverty is ineradicable, markets fail, and revolutions lead to tyranny. Keynesianism is thus modern liberalism&#x2019;s most persuasive internal critique, meeting two centuries of crisis with a proposal for capital without capitalism and revolution without revolutionaries.<br><br>If our current crises have renewed Keynesianism for so many, it is less because the present is worth saving, than because the future seems out of control. In that situation, Keynesianism is a perfect fit: a faith for the faithless.</p><p><b>Geoff Mann</b> is Director of the Centre for Global Political Economy, Simon Fraser University. He is the author of <i>Disassembly Required: A Field Guide to Actually Existing Capitalism</i> and <i>Our Daily Bread: Wages, Workers and the Political Economy of the American West</i>.&#x201c;There have been many biographies of Keynes and many histories of the &#x2018;Keynesian revolution in government.&#x2019; Mann&#x2019;s book belongs to neither category. Brilliant ... compelling.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Adam Tooze, <i>London Review of Books</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;In Geoff Mann&#x2019;s account, Keynesianism ultimately helped sever economists from their own rich tradition of heretical political philosophy and reduced them to platitudinous apologists for plutocracy ... [this] is more provocative for what it implies, and sometimes outright asserts, about contemporary economics and the precarious civilization it promises to preserve.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Matt Seybold, <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Geoff Mann is well aware of the distinctions between Keynes the man, his work, and &#x2018;Keynesianism.&#x2019; But his book on Keynesianism, <i>In the Long Run We Are All Dead</i>, is quite deliberately more about the &#x2018;ism&#x2019; than the man.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Mike Beggs, <i>Jacobin</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Enjoyable ... will appeal to general readers as well as those with specialist knowledge ... Readers who want to find the answers to radical critiques of Keynesianism will be inspired by the book&#x2019;s robust discussions of questions around revolution, political economy and liberty.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Financial Times</i></b> <br><br> &#x201c;A detailed, fast-flowing account of how repeatedly guileful Keynesianism crisis management has saved the elite by reengineering tragedy ... rewarding reading.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Danny Dorling, author of <i>Inequality and the 1%</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Mann&#x2019;s treatment of Keynes is a very interesting effort to situate his work in a longer political and philosophical debate going back to the French revolution. He treats Keynesianism as the alternative to economic collapse and/or revolution and argues that insofar as leftists have come to embrace it, they have quite explicitly given up hope for an alternative to capitalism.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Dean Baker, author of <i>The End of Loser Liberalism</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Mann makes it clear that Keynes&#x2019;s critique of liberalism can be found already in Hegel; and that now we need to leave behind the caution of the great philosopher and the great economist, thus realizing a radical alternative to capitalism. This is a provocative, original and brilliant book.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Domenico Losurdo, author of <i>Liberalism: A Counter-History</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Urgent and lucid ... A bravura inquiry into the intellectual history of the present and the ambiguous vitality of Keynes&#x2019;s <i>General Theory</i>.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Alberto Toscano, author of <i>Fanaticism: On the Uses of an Idea</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A critical rereading of Keynes, who comes across less as the liberal reformist intent on keeping capitalism (and the bourgeois order) intact, than someone attentive to the tensions within the system and, for all of its flaws, fearful of the grave dangers of leaping toward an unknown revolutionary future. <i>In the Long Run We Are All Dead</i> makes for a startling, bracing and important read.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Michael J. Watts, University of California, Berkeley</b><br><br> &#x201c;They say that we are all Keynesians in a foxhole, but In the long run we are all dead goes much deeper. Profound and provocative, the book turns political and intellectual history inside out, offering nothing short of an original critique of the political economy of liberal government and capitalist modernity. Far from a pedantic discussion of what Keynes really meant, Mann takes us from Hegel to Picketty, and much in between, in search of what Keynes and Keynesianism really mean. His answers are sometimes surprising, occasionally unsettling, and never less than urgently relevant.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Jamie Peck, University of British Columbia</b><br><br> &#x201c;Geoff Mann&#x2019;s fascinating, if idiosyncratic, account of Keynesianism is punctuated by long forays into the history of philosophy, the history of the French Revolution and the history of economic thought. The book is broad in scope and imaginative. And the co-existence of poverty and plenty is just one of several overarching tensions animating the account.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Michal Rozworski, Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives</b><br><br> &#x201c;Geoff Mann&#x2019;s stimulating book identifies a current of critical thought which stretches at least from the French Revolution, through Hegel and Keynes, to the present.<br><b> &#x2014;Bill Dunn, <i>Antipode</i></b></p><h2>Ballerina</h2><p>Find everything your child needs to know to improve their ballet in this book and DVD.

But the case becomes darkly complicated by the suicide of another Bell and Wakefield student&#x2014;a death that leads them to uncover an especially nasty group of rich and privileged students with a predilection for guns and violence. Decker thought he understood kids, yet the closer he and his team get to the truth, the clearer it becomes that he knows very little about them, including his own charge, Gabe.

At one point or another in this book, you will experience several different reactions - excitement, curiosity, joy, laughter, or even tears - but the ultimate goal is to encourage and challenge you to make a decision to do the impossible. That may have a totally different meaning to you than it did to Steve Jobs, Thomas Edison, or any of the other role models we will look at; but whatever Doing the Impossible means to you, the goal of this book is to help you realize that you have the capacity to do what the critics think is impossible. - Patrick Bet-David, Introduction to Doing the Impossible. Doing the Impossible is a roadmap for those who want to do something big with their lives. The book goes over 25 steps that the reader should take to re-create themselves, identify their cause, and make history. Patrick Bet-David shares his own impossible crusade and gives key principles for anyone looking to do the same.</p><p>Patrick Bet-David has been called a renaissance man because of his interesting philosophies on politics, sports, history, humor, and life. He has spoken in front of tens of thousands of people over the past thirteen years on these topics and more. Patrick Bet-David was born and raised in revolutionary Iran. He immigrated to the United States with his family at the age of twelve in 1990. Bet-David joined the U.S. Army in 1997, where he was stationed with the 101st Airborne Division. After he was discharged from the army, Bet-David got involved in the financial services industry.

PHP now has agents in thirty-three states where they market life insurance, annuities, and other financial instruments to families.</p><h2>Young Avengers 2: Alternative Cultures</h2><p>Ever wonder what the super hero equivalent of a terrible soul-sucking, talent-wasting temp job is? Wonder what Tommy (aka Speed) has been up to? Wonder why mutant David Alleyne (aka Prodigy) hasn't been even in the background in any one of the eight thousand X-books? Discover answers herein! Then: existential horror turns cosmic horror as something emerges from the shadows of the past...and it seems that the Young Avengers have one more thing to worry about. The team races desperately across the multi verse in pursuit of their missing friend, but their road trip goes crazy as it reaches its desti nati on. Because its desti nati on is mainly excitement and heartbreak. Several Young Avengers decide what to do next. The question is, whether they stay Young Avengers! Plus: Are you ready for Mother's Day?<br><br> <strong>COLLECTING:</strong> YOUNG AVENGERS 6-10<br><br></p><p>An award-winning critic and journalist, Kieron Gillen has written for organizations such as PC Gamer, The Guardian, Rock Paper Shotgun and Wired before turning his attention to comics. His previous writing credits include the critically lauded Phonogram, Thor, S.W.O.R.D. and Generation Hope. He has relaunched two longstanding Marvel series in Uncanny X-Men and Journey into Mystery.This team of teen and new-adult superheroes continues their galactic, dimension-spanning adventure directly from volume 1. Under the guidance of a teenage Loki, Norse god of mischief, the team is happily gallivanting through space when they are approached by Prodigy, a one-time militant mutant and current staggering genius, with warnings of a dire interdimensional threat. So begins the journey through alternate realities to confront a terrifyingly powerful tyrant called Mother. Despite the growing ensemble, Gillen makes each character distinct and likable and keeps the gay relationship between Wiccan and Hulkling at the heart of the story for some satisfying emotional stakes. As with the previous one, this slim volume is a quick read with snappy dialogue and fast, cleanly depicted action that pops with cinematic digital coloring effects. Though this is solidly a part of Marvel&#x2019;s overall continuity and clearly segues into the next volume, teens will enjoy the characters&#x2019; youth-oriented plights and have their curiosities piqued as Loki&#x2019;s true agenda starts becoming clearer.

Captain Haven is a prisoner; his son Wintrow, who bears the Vestritt blood, finds himself competing with Kennit for Vivacia's love as she becomes a pirate ship. Althea Vestritt, in training to become Vivacia's captain, arrives home to discover her beloved ship lost. Brashen Trell, her old friend and shipmate, proposes that they sail to Vivacia's rescue in the liveship Paragon, who has lost two previous crews and is believed mad. Malta, Althea's niece, seeks help from her suitor, the Rain Wild Trader Reyn, whose family is the Vestritt's major creditor.

But the <i>Vivacia</i> has been seized by the ruthless pirate captain Kennit, who holds Althea's nephew and his father hostage.

He tells the captivating story of how slaves and the children of slaves used this music to affirm their essential humanity in the face of oppression. The blues are shown to be a &#34;this-worldly&#34; expression of cultural and political rebellion. The spirituals tell about the &#34;attempt to carve out a significant existence in a very trying situation.&#34;</p><p><b>James H. Cone,</b> Bill and Judith Moyers Distinguished Professor of Systematic Theology at Union Theological Seminary, is widely regarded as one of the most influential theologians in America. His books include <i>Black Theology &amp; Black Power, A Black Theology of Liberation, The Spirituals &amp; the Blues, God of the Oppressed, Martin &amp; Malcolm &amp; America: A Dream or a Nightmare</i> and <i>The Cross and the Lynching Tree.</i>Although this book is only slightly revised from its 1972 original ( LJ 5/15/72), it deserves special mention because it unites two distinctive African American musical forms--spirituals and the blues--in their concern for liberation from oppression. Cone sees the blues as "secular spirituals" and the spirituals as code language dealing with the meaning of daily existence and hope for present and future transcendence.

Kirsch, who was one of Langdon&#x2019;s first students at Harvard two decades earlier, is about to reveal an astonishing breakthrough . . . one that will answer two of the fundamental questions of human existence.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the event begins, Langdon and several hundred guests find themselves captivated by an utterly original presentation, which Langdon realizes will be far more controversial than he ever imagined. But the meticulously orchestrated evening suddenly erupts into chaos, and Kirsch&#x2019;s precious discovery teeters on the brink of being lost forever. Reeling and facing an imminent threat, Langdon is forced into a desperate bid to escape Bilbao. With him is Ambra Vidal, the elegant museum director who worked with Kirsch to stage the provocative event. Together they flee to Barcelona on a perilous quest to locate a cryptic password that will unlock Kirsch&#x2019;s secret.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Navigating the dark corridors of hidden history and extreme religion, Langdon and Vidal must evade a tormented enemy whose all-knowing power seems to emanate from Spain&#x2019;s Royal Palace itself . . . and who will stop at nothing to silence Edmond Kirsch. On a trail marked by modern art and enigmatic symbols, Langdon and Vidal uncover clues that ultimately bring them face-to-face with Kirsch&#x2019;s shocking discovery . . . and the breathtaking truth that has long eluded us.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Origin</i> is stunningly inventive&#x2014;Dan Brown's most brilliant and entertaining novel to date.</p><p>Dan Brown is the author of numerous #1 international bestsellers, including <i>The Da Vinci Code, Inferno</i>, <i>The Lost Symbol</i>, <i>Angels &amp; Demons</i>, <i>Deception Point,</i> and <i>Digital Fortress</i>.PROLOGUE<br><br>As the ancient cogwheel train clawed its way up the dizzying incline, Edmond Kirsch surveyed the jagged mountaintop above him. In the distance, built into the face of a sheer cliff, the massive stone monastery seemed to hang in space, as if magically fused to the vertical precipice.<br><br>This timeless sanctuary in Catalonia, Spain, had endured the relentless pull of gravity for more than four centuries, never slipping from its original purpose: to insulate its occupants from the modern world.<br><br><i>Ironically, they will now be the first to learn the truth</i>, Kirsch thought, wondering how they would react. Historically, the most dangerous men on earth were men of God . . . especially when their gods became threatened. <i>And I am about to hurl a flaming spear into a hornets&#x2019; nest</i>.<br><br>When the train reached the mountaintop, Kirsch saw a solitary figure waiting for him on the platform. The wizened skeleton of a man was draped in the traditional Catholic purple cassock and white rochet, with a zucchetto on his head. Kirsch recognized his host&#x2019;s rawboned features from photos and felt an unexpected surge of adrenaline.<br><br><i>Valdespino is greeting me personally.<br><br></i>Bishop Antonio Valdespino was a formidable figure in Spain&#x2014;not only a trusted friend and counselor to the king himself, but one of the country&#x2019;s most vocal and influential advocates for the preservation of conservative Catholic values and traditional political standards.<br><br>&#x201c;Edmond Kirsch, I assume?&#x201d; the bishop intoned as Kirsch exited the train.<br><br>&#x201c;Guilty as charged,&#x201d; Kirsch said, smiling as he reached out to shake his host&#x2019;s bony hand. &#x201c;Bishop Valdespino, I want to thank you for arranging this meeting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I appreciate your <i>requesting</i> it.&#x201d; The bishop&#x2019;s voice was stronger than Kirsch expected&#x2014;clear and penetrating, like a bell. &#x201c;It is not often we are consulted by men of science, especially one of your prominence. This way, please.&#x201d;<br><br>As Valdespino guided Kirsch across the platform, the cold mountain air whipped at the bishop&#x2019;s cassock.<br><br>&#x201c;I must confess,&#x201d; Valdespino said, &#x201c;you look different than I imagined. I was expecting a scientist, but you&#x2019;re quite . . .&#x201d; He eyed his guest&#x2019;s sleek Kiton K50 suit and Barker ostrich shoes with a hint of disdain. &#x201c; &#x2018;Hip,&#x2019; I believe, is the word?&#x201d;<br><br>Kirsch smiled politely. <i>The word &#x201c;hip&#x201d; went out of style decades ago.<br><br></i>&#x201c;In reading your list of accomplishments,&#x201d; the bishop said, &#x201c;I am still not entirely sure what it is you do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I specialize in game theory and computer modeling.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you make the computer games that the children play?&#x201d;<br><br>Kirsch sensed the bishop was feigning ignorance in an attempt to be quaint. More accurately, Kirsch knew, Valdespino was a frighteningly well-informed student of technology and often warned others of its dangers. &#x201c;No, sir, actually game theory is a field of mathematics that studies patterns in order to make predictions about the future.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah yes. I believe I read that you predicted a European monetary crisis some years ago? When nobody listened, you saved the day by inventing a computer program that pulled the EU back from the dead. What was your famous quote? &#x2018;At thirty-three years old, I am the same age as Christ when He performed His resurrection.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Kirsch cringed. &#x201c;A poor analogy, Your Grace. I was young.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Young?&#x201d; The bishop chuckled. &#x201c;And how old are you now . . . perhaps forty?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just.&#x201d;<br><br>The old man smiled as the strong wind continued to billow his robe. &#x201c;Well, the meek were supposed to inherit the earth, but instead it has gone to the young&#x2014;the technically inclined, those who stare into video screens rather than into their own souls. I must admit, I never imagined I would have reason to meet the young man leading the charge. They call you a <i>prophet</i>, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a very good one in your case, Your Grace,&#x201d; Kirsch replied. &#x201c;When I asked if I might meet you and your colleagues privately, I calculated only a twenty percent chance you would accept.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And as I told my colleagues, the devout can always benefit from listening to nonbelievers. It is in hearing the voice of the devil that we can better appreciate the voice of God.&#x201d; The old man smiled. &#x201c;I am joking, of course. Please forgive my aging sense of humor. My filters fail me from time to time.&#x201d;<br><br>With that, Bishop Valdespino motioned ahead. &#x201c;The others are waiting. This way, please.&#x201d;<br><br>Kirsch eyed their destination, a colossal citadel of gray stone perched on the edge of a sheer cliff that plunged thousands of feet down into a lush tapestry of wooded foothills. Unnerved by the height, Kirsch averted his eyes from the chasm and followed the bishop along the uneven cliffside path, turning his thoughts to the meeting ahead.<br><br>Kirsch had requested an audience with three prominent religious leaders who had just finished attending a conference here.<br><br><i>The Parliament of the World&#x2019;s Religions.<br><br></i>Since 1893, hundreds of spiritual leaders from nearly thirty world religions had gathered in a different location every few years to spend a week engaged in interfaith dialogue. Participants included a wide array of influential Christian priests, Jewish rabbis, and Islamic mullahs from around the world, along with Hindu <i>pujaris</i>, Buddhist <i>bhikkhus</i>, Jains, Sikhs, and others.<br><br>The parliament&#x2019;s self-proclaimed objective was &#x201c;to cultivate harmony among the world&#x2019;s religions, build bridges between diverse spiritualities, and celebrate the intersections of all faith.&#x201d;<br><br><i>A noble quest</i>, Kirsch thought, despite seeing it as an empty exercise&#x2014; a meaningless search for random points of correspondence among a hodgepodge of ancient fictions, fables, and myths.<br><br>As Bishop Valdespino guided him along the pathway, Kirsch peered down the mountainside with a sardonic thought. <i>Moses climbed a mountain to accept the Word of God . . . and I have climbed a mountain to do quite the opposite</i>.<br><br>Kirsch&#x2019;s motivation for climbing this mountain, he had told himself, was one of ethical obligation, but he knew there was a good dose of hubris fueling this visit&#x2014; he was eager to feel the gratification of sitting face-to-face with these clerics and foretelling their imminent demise.<br><br><i>You&#x2019;ve had your run at defining our truth</i>.<br><br>&#x201c;I looked at your curriculum vitae,&#x201d; the bishop said abruptly, glancing at Kirsch. &#x201c;I see you&#x2019;re a product of Harvard University?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Undergraduate. Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see. Recently, I read that for the first time in Harvard&#x2019;s history, the incoming student body consists of more atheists and agnostics than those who identify as followers of any religion. That is quite a telling statistic, Mr. Kirsch.&#x201d;<br><br><i>What can I tell you</i>, Kirsch wanted to reply, <i>our students keep getting smarter</i>.<br><br>The wind whipped harder as they arrived at the ancient stone edifice. Inside the dim light of the building&#x2019;s entryway, the air was heavy with the thick fragrance of burning frankincense. The two men snaked through a maze of dark corridors, and Kirsch&#x2019;s eyes fought to adjust as he followed his cloaked host. Finally, they arrived at an unusually small wooden door. The bishop knocked, ducked down, and entered, motioning for his guest to follow.<br><br>Uncertain, Kirsch stepped over the threshold.<br><br>He found himself in a rectangular chamber whose high walls burgeoned with ancient leather-bound tomes. Additional freestanding bookshelves jutted out of the walls like ribs, interspersed with cast-iron radiators that clanged and hissed, giving the room the eerie sense that it was alive. Kirsch raised his eyes to the ornately balustraded walkway that encircled the second story and knew without a doubt where he was.<br><br><i>The famed library of Montserrat</i>, he realized, startled to have been admitted. This sacred room was rumored to contain uniquely rare texts accessible only to those monks who had devoted their lives to God and who were sequestered here on this mountain.<br><br>&#x201c;You asked for discretion,&#x201d; the bishop said. &#x201c;This is our most private space. Few outsiders have ever entered.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A generous privilege. Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>Kirsch followed the bishop to a large wooden table where two elderly men sat waiting. The man on the left looked timeworn, with tired eyes and a matted white beard. He wore a crumpled black suit, white shirt, and fedora.<br><br>&#x201c;This is Rabbi Yehuda K�ves,&#x201d; the bishop said. &#x201c;He is a prominent Jewish philosopher who has written extensively on Kabbalistic cosmology.&#x201d;<br><br>Kirsch reached across the table and politely shook hands with Rabbi K�ves. &#x201c;A pleasure to meet you, sir,&#x201d; Kirsch said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read your books on Kabbala. I can&#x2019;t say I understood them, but I&#x2019;ve read them.&#x201d;<br><br>K�ves gave an amiable nod, dabbing at his watery eyes with his handkerchief.<br><br>&#x201c;And here,&#x201d; the bishop continued, motioning to the other man, &#x201c;you have the respected <i>allamah</i>, Syed al-Fadl.&#x201d;<br><br>The revered Islamic scholar stood up and smiled broadly. He was short and squat with a jovial face that seemed a mismatch with his dark penetrating eyes. He was dressed in an unassuming white <i>thawb</i>. &#x201c;And, Mr. Kirsch, I have read <i>your</i> predictions on the future of mankind. I can&#x2019;t say I <i>agree</i> with them, but I have read them.&#x201d;<br><br>Kirsch gave a gracious smile and shook the man&#x2019;s hand.<br><br>&#x201c;And our guest, Edmond Kirsch,&#x201d; the bishop concluded, addressing his two colleagues, &#x201c;as you know, is a highly regarded computer scientist, game theorist, inventor, and something of a prophet in the technological world. Considering his background, I was puzzled by his request to address the three of us. Therefore, I shall now leave it to Mr. Kirsch to explain why he has come.&#x201d;<br><br>With that, Bishop Valdespino took a seat between his two colleagues, folded his hands, and gazed up expectantly at Kirsch. All three men faced him like a tribunal, creating an ambience more like that of an inquisition than a friendly meeting of scholars. The bishop, Kirsch now realized, had not even set out a chair for him.<br><br>Kirsch felt more bemused than intimidated as he studied the three aging men before him. <i>So this is the Holy Trinity I requested. The Three Wise Men</i>.<br><br>Pausing a moment to assert his power, Kirsch walked over to the window and gazed out at the breathtaking panorama below. A sunlit patchwork of ancient pastoral lands stretched across a deep valley, giving way to the rugged peaks of the Collserola mountain range. Miles beyond, somewhere out over the Balearic Sea, a menacing bank of storm clouds was now gathering on the horizon.<br><br><i>Fitting</i>, Kirsch thought, sensing the turbulence he would soon cause in this room, and in the world beyond.<br><br>&#x201c;Gentlemen,&#x201d; he commenced, turning abruptly back toward them. &#x201c;I believe Bishop Valdespino has already conveyed to you my request for secrecy. Before we continue, I just want to clarify that what I am about to share with you must be kept in the strictest confidence. Simply stated, I am asking for a vow of silence from all of you. Are we in agreement?&#x201d;<br><br>All three men gave nods of tacit acquiescence, which Kirsch knew were probably redundant anyway. <i>They will want to bury this information&#x2014;not broadcast it.<br><br></i>&#x201c;I am here today,&#x201d; Kirsch began, &#x201c;because I have made a scientific discovery I believe you will find startling. It is something I have pursued for many years, hoping to provide answers to two of the most fundamental questions of our human experience. Now that I have succeeded, I have come to you specifically because I believe this information will affect the world&#x2019;s <i>faithful</i> in a profound way, quite possibly causing a shift that can only be described as, shall we say&#x2014;disruptive. At the moment, I am the only person on earth who has the information I am about to reveal to you.&#x201d;<br><br>Kirsch reached into his suit coat and pulled out an oversized smartphone&#x2014;one that he had designed and built to serve his own unique needs. The phone had a vibrantly colored mosaic case, and he propped it up before the three men like a television. In a moment, he would use the device to dial into an ultrasecure server, enter his forty-seven-character password, and live-stream a presentation for them.<br><br>&#x201c;What you are about to see,&#x201d; Kirsch said, &#x201c;is a rough cut of an announcement I hope to share with the world&#x2014;perhaps in a month or so. But before I do, I wanted to consult with a few of the world&#x2019;s most influential religious thinkers, to gain insight into how this news will be received by those it affects most.&#x201d;<br><br>The bishop sighed loudly, sounding more bored than concerned. &#x201c;An intriguing preamble, Mr. Kirsch. You speak as if whatever you are about to show us will shake the foundations of the world&#x2019;s religions.&#x201d;<br><br>Kirsch glanced around the ancient repository of sacred texts. <i>It will not shake your foundations. It will shatter them.<br><br></i>Kirsch appraised the men before him. What they did not know was that in only three days&#x2019; time, Kirsch planned to go public with this presentation in a stunning, meticulously choreographed event. When he did, people across the world would realize that the teachings of all religions did indeed have one thing in common.<br><br>They were all dead wrong.<br><br>CHAPTER 1<br><br>Professor Robert Langdon gazed up at the forty-foot-tall dog sitting in the plaza.

His father has instructed him to keep his eyes peeled for interesting sights on the way to and from school, but all Marco has seen is a boring old horse and wagon. Imagine if he had something more to report, say, a zebra pulling the wagon. Or better yet, the zebra could be pulling a blue and gold chariot. No, wait! Maybe it should be a reindeer in that harness. Marco's story grows ever more elaborate as he reasons that a reindeer would be happier pulling a sled, then that a <i>really</i> unusual sight would be an elephant with a ruby-bedecked rajah enthroned on top. "Say! That makes a story that <i>no one</i> can beat, / When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street."

As a teenager he began to work with teachers who gave him exercises to reverse his blindness. Within four years he gained a remarkable degree of vision, and began developing a system of therapeutic exercise combining movement, breathing, and mental imagery. When he began working with others, miraculous recoveries ensued.<p>Movement for Self-Healing details Schneider's methods of stimulating the natural healing powers of the body, with specific guidelines for improving vision, back problems, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, breathing, and muscular dystrophy.</p></p><p>The author, founder and director of the Center for Self-Healing in San Francisco, states that with determination, hard work, and deep inner knowledge, anyone can overcome "incurable" disease. A Russian-born Israeli, Schneider was blind until age 17, when a companion taught him the unorthodox Bates method of eye exercise, which restored his sight. He became a teacher and massage therapist in Tel Aviv, and emigrated to the United States in 1975. In this personal narrative, Schneider recounts his unusual life and work with victims of chronic degenerative diseases. A good addition to collections on alternative medicine.

Atkins was also chosen by the Robert B. Parker estate to continue the highly popular Spenser novels. A former journalist who cut his teeth as a crime reporter in the newsroom of "The Tampa Tribune," he published his first novel, "Crossroad Blues," at 27 and became a full-time novelist at 30. While at the "Tribune," Ace earned a Pulitzer Prize nomination for a feature series based on his investigation into a forgotten murder of the 1950s. The story became the core of his critically acclaimed novel, "White Shadow, " which earned raves from noted authors and critics. In his next novels, "Wicked City, ""Devil's Garden," and "Infamous," blended first-hand interviews and original research into police and court records with tightly woven plots and incisive characters. The historical novels told great American stories by weaving fact and fiction into a colorful, seamless tapestry.<br>"The Ranger" represents a return to Ace's first love: hero-driven series fiction. Quinn Colson is a real hero--a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan--who returns home to north Mississippi to fight corruption on his home turf. Ace lives on a historic farm outside Oxford, Mississippi with his family.Best known for historical thrillers like Infamous, Atkins kicks off a new series with a solid action-packed yarn featuring U.S. Army Ranger Quinn Colson. When Colson returns home to Jericho, Miss., from his most recent tour of duty in Afghanistan for his uncle's funeral, he's surprised to learn that his uncle, former sheriff Hampton Beckett, shot himself to death. An old friend, Deputy Lillie Virgil, suspects that Beckett was actually murdered. Colson's efforts to prove that theory bring him up against both the violent and the corrupt. During Colson's time away, his rural community has been overrun with meth dealers, whose blight affects those close to him. The contours of the story line are a bit too familiar&#x2014;the prodigal son returning home to clean up the town&#x2014;and the setup for sequels is predictable, but the author's superior prose will carry most readers along and raise hopes for more original plotting next time.

Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness. <p> Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate -- a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister -- and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves. </p><p> <i>My Sister's Keeper</i> examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you?

The mechanics I understood -- my older brother Jesse had filled me in -- although at the time I was sure he'd heard half of it wrong. Other kids my age were busy looking up the words <i>penis</i> and <i>vagina</i> in the classroom dictionary when the teacher had her back turned, but I paid attention to different details. Like why some mothers only had one child, while other families seemed to multiply before your eyes. Or how the new girl in school, Sedona, told anyone who'd listen that she was named for the place where her parents were vacationing when they made her (<i>"Good thing they weren't staying in Jersey City,"</i> my father used to say). </p><p></p><p></p><p>Now that I am thirteen, these distinctions are only more complicated: the eighth-grader who dropped out of school because she <i>got into trouble;</i> a neighbor who <i>got herself pregnant</i> in the hopes it would keep her husband from filing for divorce. I'm telling you, if aliens landed on earth today and took a good hard look at why babies get born, they'd conclude that most people have children by accident, or because they drink too much on a certain night, or because birth control isn't one hundred percent, or for a thousand other reasons that really aren't very flattering.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On the other hand, I was born for a very specific purpose. I wasn't the result of a cheap bottle of wine or a full moon or the heat of the moment. I was born because a scientist managed to hook up my mother's eggs and my father's sperm to create a specific combination of precious genetic material. In fact, when Jesse told me how babies get made and I, the great disbeliever, decided to ask my parents the truth, I got more than I bargained for. They sat me down and told me all the usual stuff, of course -- but they also explained that they chose little embryonic me, specifically, because I could save my sister, Kate. "We loved you even more," my mother made sure to say, "because we knew what exactly we were getting."</p><p></p><p></p><p>It made me wonder, though, what would have happened if Kate had been healthy. Chances are, I'd still be floating up in Heaven or wherever, waiting to be attached to a body to spend some time on Earth. Certainly I would not be part of this family. See, unlike the rest of the free world, I didn't get here by accident. And if your parents have you for a reason, then that reason better exist. Because once it's gone, so are you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Pawnshops may be full of junk, but they're also a breeding ground for stories, if you ask me, not that you did. What happened to make a person trade in the Never Before Worn Diamond Solitaire? Who needed money so badly they'd sell a teddy bear missing an eye? As I walk up to the counter, I wonder if someone will look at the locket I'm about to give up, and ask these same questions. </p><p></p><p></p><p>The man at the cash register has a nose the shape of a turnip, and eyes sunk so deep I can't imagine how he sees well enough to go about his business. "Need something?" he asks. </p><p></p><p></p><p>It's all I can do to not turn around and walk out the door, pretend I've come in by mistake. The only thing that keeps me steady is knowing I am not the first person to stand in front of this counter holding the one item in the world I never thought I'd part with.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I have something to sell," I tell him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Am I supposed to guess what it is?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Oh." Swallowing, I pull the locket out of the pocket of my jeans. The heart falls on the glass counter in a pool of its own chain. "It's </p><p></p><p></p><p>fourteen-karat gold," I pitch. "Hardly ever worn." This is a lie; until this morning, I haven't taken it off in seven years. My father gave it to me when I was six after the bone marrow harvest, because he said anyone who was giving her sister such a major present deserved one of her own. Seeing it there, on the counter, my neck feels shivery and naked.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The owner puts a loop up to his eye, which makes it seem almost normal size. "I'll give you twenty."</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>"Dollars?"</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>"No, pesos. What did you think?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"It's worth five times that!" I'm guessing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The owner shrugs. "I'm not the one who needs the money."</p><p></p><p></p><p>I pick up the locket, resigned to sealing the deal, and the strangest thing happens -- my hand, it just clamps shut like the Jaws of Life. My face goes red with the effort to peel apart my fingers. It takes what seems like an hour for that locket to spill into the owner's outstretched palm. His eyes stay on my face, softer now. "Tell them you lost it," he offers, advice tossed in for free.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If Mr. Webster had decided to put the word <i>freak</i> in his dictionary, <i>Anna Fitzgerald</i> would be the best definition he could give. It's more than just the way I look: refugee-skinny with absolutely no chest to speak of, hair the color of dirt, connect-the-dot freckles on my cheeks that, let me tell you, do not fade with lemon juice or sunscreen or even, sadly, sandpaper. No, God was obviously in some kind of mood on my birthday, because he added to this fabulous physical combination the bigger picture -- the household into which I was born. </p><p></p><p></p><p>My parents tried to make things normal, but that's a relative term. The truth is, I was never really a kid. To be honest, neither were Kate and Jesse. I guess maybe my brother had his moment in the sun for the four years he was alive before Kate got diagnosed, but ever since then, we've been too busy looking over our shoulders to run headlong into growing up. You know how most little kids think they're like cartoon characters -- if an anvil drops on their heads they can peel themselves off the sidewalk and keep going? Well, I never once believed that. How could I, when we practically set a place for Death at the dinner table? </p><p></p><p></p><p>Kate has acute promyelocytic leukemia. Actually, that's not quite true -- right now she doesn't have it, but it's hibernating under her skin like a bear, until it decides to roar again. She was diagnosed when she was two; she's sixteen now. <i>Molecular relapse</i> and <i>granulocyte</i> and <i>portacath</i> -- these words are part of my vocabulary, even though I'll never find them on any SAT. I'm an allogeneic donor -- a perfect sibling match. When Kate needs leukocytes or stem cells or bone marrow to fool her body into thinking it's healthy, I'm the one who provides them. Nearly every time Kate's hospitalized, I wind up there, too.</p><p></p><p></p><p>None of which means anything, except that you shouldn't believe what you hear about me, least of all that which I tell you myself. </p><p></p><p></p><p>As I am coming up the stairs, my mother comes out of her room wearing another ball gown. "Ah," she says, turning her back to me. "Just the girl I wanted to see."</p><p></p><p></p><p>I zip it up and watch her twirl. My mother could be beautiful, if she were parachuted into someone else's life. She has long dark hair and the fine collarbones of a princess, but the corners of her mouth turn down, like she's swallowed bitter news. She doesn't have much free time, since a calendar is something that can change drastically if my sister develops a bruise or a nosebleed, but what she does have she spends at Bluefly.com, ordering ridiculously fancy evening dresses for places she is never going to go. "What do you think?" she asks.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The gown is all the colors of a sunset, and made out of material that swishes when she moves. It's strapless, what a star might wear sashaying down a red carpet -- totally not the dress code for a suburban house in Upper Darby, RI. My mother twists her hair into a knot and holds it in place. On her bed are three other dresses -- one slinky and black, one bugle-beaded, one that seems impossibly small. "You look..."</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Tired</i>. The word bubbles right under my lips. </p><p></p><p></p><p>My mother goes perfectly still, and I wonder if I've said it without meaning to. She holds up a hand, shushing me, her ear cocked to the open doorway. "Did you hear that?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Hear what?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Kate."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I didn't hear anything." </p><p></p><p></p><p>But she doesn't take my word for it, because when it comes to Kate she doesn't take anybody's word for it.

Crammed into old houses and hotels, abandoned prisons and empty hospitals, the spirits that linger continue to capture our collective imagination, but why? His own fascination piqued by a house hunt in Los Angeles that revealed derelict foreclosures and "zombie homes," Dickey embarks on a journey across the continental United States to decode and unpack the American history repressed in our most famous haunted places. Some have established reputations as "the most haunted mansion in America," or "the most haunted prison"; others, like the haunted Indian burial grounds in West Virginia, evoke memories from the past our collective nation tries to forget.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With boundless curiosity, Dickey conjures the dead by focusing on questions of the living<b>&#x2014;</b>how do we, the living, deal with stories about ghosts, and how do we inhabit and move through spaces that have been deemed, for whatever reason, haunted?

As a writer, speaker, and academic, he has made a career out of collecting unusual objects and hidden histories all over the country. He's a regular contributor to the<i>&nbsp;LA Review of Books</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Lapham's Quarterly,</i>&nbsp;and is the co-editor (with Joanna Ebenstein) of <i>The Morbid Anatomy Anthology. </i>He is also a member of the Order of the Good Death, a collective of artists, writers, and death industry professionals interested in improving the Western world's relationship with mortality.

There are children playing outside on East Fourth Street; it is August, and they are wild, they are shouting and running through the street, trying to gather up the last of the season before the fall sets in. There is nothing unusual about any of this. Then the door swings open at 29 East Fourth Street, and an old woman emerges on to the stoop overlooking the street, waving her arms wildly and shouting to the children to be quiet. The children, as well as the adults on the street, all recognize her: Gertrude Tredwell, who&#x2019;s lived in the house for over ninety years, born there only a few years after her father purchased it in 1935. She is enraged; she tells them they are being far too noisy, they must calm down. The children quiet, turning towards the high staircase that leads to Gertrude&#x2019;s front door, looking up with fear at the old woman who, satisfied, returns indoors and shuts the door.&nbsp;<br></i><br><i>There&#x2019;s nothing unusual about any of this&#x2014;except that Gertrude Tredwell has been dead now for several weeks.<br></i><br><i>It is not the last time Gertrude Tredwell will be seen at the house on East Fourth Street. In the months after her death, the house falls into the hands of a distant cousin; since by then most of the old merchant houses of lower Manhattan were gone, he decides to preserve the house as a museum, first opening it in 1936. Open to the public, over the years there are dozens of sightings of odd and inexplicable things happening in the house. In the early 1980s tourists come across the house and ring the bell. A woman in period costume tells them politely that the museum is closed for the day, and could they please come back at another time. Later, when they call the house to get the hours, they are told that the museum was in fact open when they came by, and that, furthermore, none of the staff ever dresses in period costume. Gertrude has also been seen inside the house, sometimes humming, sometimes playing the piano&#x2014;always appearing as a frail, petite woman in period costume.<br></i><br><i>Nor is she alone. A visitor to the house in the summer of 1995 claimed that while upstairs she had a lengthy conversation with an older gentleman in a tattered suit and a heavy wool jacket smelling of mothballs, who talked to her of what the house was like to live in. After listening to him for a few minutes, she turned her back on him for a moment, and when she looked back, he was gone. Later she identified the man she&#x2019;d seen from photographs: Samuel Lenox Tredwell, Gertrude&#x2019;s brother, who&#x2019;d died in 1917.<br></i><br><br>Ghost stories like these mean more than we are usually prepared to admit. If you want to understand a place, ignore the boastful monuments and landmarks, and go straight to the haunted houses. Look for the darkened graveyards, the derelict hotels, the emptied and decaying old hospitals. Wait past midnight, and see what appears. Tune out the patriotic speeches and sanctioned narratives, and listen instead for the bumps in the night. You won&#x2019;t need an electronic device to capture the voices of the dead; a patient ear and an open mind will do. Once you start looking, you&#x2019;ll find them everywhere.<br><br>&#x201c;We tell ourselves stories in order to live,&#x201d; Joan Didion once wrote, and that is just as true of ghost stories: we tell stories of the dead as a way of making sense of the living. More than just simple urban legends and campfire tales, ghost stories reveal the contours of our anxieties, the nature of our collective fears and desires, the things we can&#x2019;t talk about in any other way. The past we&#x2019;re most afraid to speak of aloud in the bright light of day is the same past that tends to linger in the ghost stories we whisper in the dark.<br><br>Ghost stories are as old as human civilization, appearing in the earliest written epics and throughout the ancient world. In one of his letters the Roman writer Pliny the Younger describes a house haunted by a ghost "in the form of an old man, of extremely emaciated and squalid appearance, with a long beard and disheveled hair, rattling the chains on his feet and hands." The house remained vacant until the philosopher Athenodorus rented it; his first night he waited up for the ghost, writing in his study, until the apparition appeared.<br><br>Athenodorus, according to Pliny, was not in a hurry, and when confronted by the ghost &#x201c;made a sign with his hand that he should wait a little, and threw his eyes again upon his papers.&#x201d; Eventually the philosopher allowed the ghost to lead him outside of the house into the yard, where he vanished. The next morning, Athenodorus dug up the spot where the ghost had disappeared, and found the remains of a skeleton in chains that had been long neglected. He gave the corpse a proper burial, and the haunting ceased.<br><br>Ghosts bridge the past to the present; they speak across the seemingly insurmountable barriers of death and time, connecting us to what we thought was lost. They give us hope for a life beyond death, and because of this help us to cope with loss and grief. Their presence is the promise that we don&#x2019;t have to say goodbye to our loved ones right away, and&#x2014;is with Athendorous&#x2019;s haunting&#x2014;what was left undone in one&#x2019;s life might yet be finished by one&#x2019;s ghost.<br><br>Perhaps this is why, even without centuries-old castles or ruined abbeys, the United States is as ghost-haunted as anywhere else in the world&#x2014;perhaps even more so. You&#x2019;ll find ghosts in the stately plantations of the South, in the wilds of the plains states, in the ornate hotels of California, in the wooden colonials in the Northeast. They roam the streets of rustbelt cities like Detroit and Buffalo, and they haunt the gothic cities of the South. You&#x2019;ll find them in abandoned mining towns, and in the bustling metropolis of New York City.&nbsp;<br><br>Forty-five percent of Americans say they believe in ghosts, and almost a third say they&#x2019;ve witnessed them firsthand. Though this belief lies outside the ways we normally explain the world&#x2014;contradicting science and complicating religion&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a difficult belief to shake. That we continue believing in ghosts despite our rational mind&#x2019;s skepticism suggests that in these stories lies something crucial to the way we understand the world around us. We cannot look away, because we know something important is there.<br><br>*<br><br>The Merchant&#x2019;s House Museum in lower Manhattan has stood by itself against the din and rush of the city; it has stood for one hundred and eighty years and might stand for that many more. Within, walls continue upright, bricks meet neatly, wood floors give gently under foot, and spirits gather.&nbsp;<br><br>The house was bought by Seabury Tredwell in 1835 when he retired. Owner of a large hardware firm, he had eight children altogether, the last of whom, Gertrude, was born there in 1840 when Tredwell was sixty. Gertrude never married; she had one suitor, but her father disapproved of his Catholicism. And so she lived out her life in the house on 4th Street, her siblings dying one by one until only she remained. Over time, she focused her energies on keeping the house exactly as Seabury intended it, maintaining its nineteenth century charm until she died, at the age of ninety-three, in 1933. A distant cousin acquired the house, and since by then most of the old merchant houses of lower Manhattan were gone, he decided to preserve Tredwell&#x2019;s home, first opening it to the public as a museum in 1936. The ghosts, they say, came quickly thereafter.<br><br>The Merchant&#x2019;s House is a prime example of a grand old American haunted house. Its exterior is stately, refined, with a touch of frayed elegance. Its front door welcomes, even as it seems to be hiding something. Inside, the floors creak without warning, without any sense of someone there. The old wood is thick with the humidity, as if the walls and floors still breathe. It stands as the oldest brownstone in New York with its furniture still intact. All around it are gleaming glass and steel towers of the modern age, bustling with life still living.<br><br>It is easy to feel as though you&#x2019;re stepping back in time as you walk in the steps of those long gone. And it&#x2019;s easy, in such a well-worn house, to feel that something is not quite right: an invisible presence, a trace of something that doesn&#x2019;t belong. Through the years guests have reported feeling cold spots, or seeing strange, wispy streaks of light, some of which have been captured on film. Paranormal researchers have conducted EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) sessions in the house, turning on a tape recorder and asking questions to an empty room, playing back the tape later in hopes the ghosts will have answered back. Several EVPs from the house have recorded bits of faint, muddled noise that some claim are voices speaking from the beyond.<br><br>But these events alone are easy for a skeptic to brush aside, and discount. A paranormal event without a story is tenuous, fragile. What makes it &#x201c;real,&#x201d; at least in a sense, is the story, the tale that grounds the event. That sense of the uncanny, of something not-quite-right, of things ever-so-slightly off, cries out for an explanation, and often we turn to ghosts. Just as an oyster turns a speck of dirt into a pearl, the ghost story doesn&#x2019;t make the feeling disappear, but can transform it into something more stable, less unsettling.&nbsp;<br><br>Long before the word &#x201c;haunting&#x201d; became associated with ghosts, it meant simply&nbsp;<i>to frequent</i>, in the way teenage kids haunt a park or drunks haunt a bar. A house like the Merchant&#x2019;s House Museum is haunted, then, by use and by habitude, by grooves worn into the floors and walls&#x2014;as though you could map out the daily patterns of the people who&#x2019;d lived here by analyzing these signs of wear.<br><br>The ghosts at the Merchant House emerge not only out of the uncanny feeling we get from creaking wood and antiquated architecture, but also from the stories about its one-time inhabitants that are told and retold over the years and embellished where necessary to heighten the drama. Tales of Gertrude emphasize that she never married, that after her father disapproved of her only suitor, and that she promised him she&#x2019;d stay single and live in his home. The spinster who honored her father&#x2019;s wishes even after his death, Gertrude seems tragic, bordering on the pathological. Even before her death, she haunted this house&#x2014;an emotionally stunted recluse, unable to let go of her attachment to her father.<br><br>Samuel Tredwell, by contrast, is described as a &#x201c;black sheep,&#x201d; someone who never amounted to much and was disinherited by the family. This is a tad unfair; Samuel followed in his father&#x2019;s footsteps as a merchant, specializing in china and crockery, though he was not the success his father had been. He was indeed written out of Seabury&#x2019;s final will, mainly due to debts he&#x2019;d incurred in the wake of the Civil War (Seabury instead left a trust in Samuel&#x2019;s daughter&#x2019;s name). But the legends of the Merchant House exaggerate the tensions and family drama, relying on melodramatic caricatures. The sight of Samuel&#x2019;s ghost is far more exciting and menacing, after all, if he&#x2019;s come back from the grave to claim his rightful inheritance.&nbsp;<br><br>A spinster, and one who seemed to resist time in a place as restless as New York City, Gertrude Tredwell embodies a set of ideas&#x2014;and anxieties&#x2014;about women, domesticity, and modernity. Likewise, in the ghost of threadbare Samuel Tredwell we have a story of disinheritance and filial failure that reflects how we as a culture treat men who don&#x2019;t live up to certain concepts of masculinity. Add to this the overbearing portrait of Seabury himself, and what the Merchant&#x2019;s House offers is an uncanny portrait of the American family, one that frustrates our basic assumptions about how a father and his children should act.<br><br>Instead of, or perhaps in addition to, the supernatural, old buildings are haunted by their memories: memories of those who once inhabited them, and the memories we bring to them. We&#x2019;re conditioned, after all, to conflate memory and physical space. At the same time that Pliny was writing his tale of Athenodorus&#x2019;s haunted house, Cicero and Quintillian were developing a technique for remembering great quantities of information known as a &#x201c;memory palace.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>Rather than direct memorization, one imagines a house and &#x201c;places&#x201d; different parts of a speech in different rooms&#x2014;the first point in one&#x2019;s speech is placed in the entryway to the home, the second point in the first room, and so on. To remember the speech, the orator simply has to &#x201c;walk&#x201d; through the house in her or his mind, picking up each aspect of the speech as she or he moves through the building. The technique suggests the degree to which memory is spatial, or at least primed to work spatially: our brains are hardwired to think in terms of place, and to associate psychic value or meaning to the places we inhabit.<br><br>Just as imaginary houses may be used to remember things, real physical houses may have their own memories&#x2014;or at least memories we project on them. A haunted house is a memory palace made real: a physical space that retains memories that might otherwise be forgotten, , or which might remain only in fragments. Under the invisible weight of these memories, the habits of those who once haunted these places, we feel the shudder of the ghost.<br><br>*<br><br>Ghosts, Thomas W. Laqueur writes, are "a representation of the unrepresentable: the dead who were somewhere." In a world where nearly every moment of our lives is photographed, recorded, and documented, the gaps in the past still beckon us. Searching for ghosts can be an attempt to reconstruct what is lost. By sifting through time for stories that have been misplaced or forgotten, we listen to the voices that call out to be remembered. Our ghost stories center on unfinished endings, broken relationships, things left unexplained. They offer an alternative kind of history, foregrounding those precisely what might otherwise be ignored.<br><br>Ghost stories are a way of talking about things we&#x2019;re not otherwise allowed to discuss: a forbidden history we thought bricked up safely in the walls. They cover up over the gaps and in the process help us assuage our anxieties, providing a rationale after the fact. Just as Gertrude Tredwell&#x2019;s life has informed the ghost stories that now circulate around her, so too does the legend of her ghost make meaning out of her life. Those aspects of a life that are discontinuous, fragmented, or unexpected, are made whole through the ghost story.<br><br>In her study of the ghost stories of the Hudson Valley in New York, Judith Richardson describes how one ghost in particular has changed shape through the decades to suit different needs of different eras. For over two centuries, residents in the village of Leeds, New York, have reported seeing a spectral apparition of a ghostly horse riding down the main road, dragging behind it a young woman. The story, in its most basic form, has to do with a cruel master who wickedly killed a young servant girl as punishment for some minor transgression. When she was invoked by writer Miriam Coles Harris in her 1862 novel&nbsp;<i>The Sutherlands,&nbsp;</i>the ghostly victim is a slave of African and Native American descent; Coles Harris used her as a parable in the vein of<i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin,&nbsp;</i>castigating not only ...</p><h2>Too Big to Fail: The Inside Story of How Wall Street and Washington Fought to Save the FinancialS ystem--and Themselves</h2><p><b>Named a Best Book of the Year by:<i> The Economist, The Financial Times, Business Week</i>, and&nbsp;800-CEO-Read<br></b><br><b>Winner of the Gerald Loeb Award for Best Business Book</b><br><br><b>&#x201c;<i>Too Big To Fail </i>is too good to put down. . . .

He was recovering from a slight hangover, but his head really hurt for a different reason: <i>He knew too much</i>.</p><p>It was just past 7:00 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, September 13, 2008. Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, the nation&#x2019;s third largest bank, had spent part of the prior evening at an emergency, all-hands-on-deck meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with a dozen of his rival Wall Street CEOs. Their assignment was to come up with a plan to save Lehman Brothers, the nation&#x2019;s fourth-largest investment bank&#x2014;or risk the collateral damage that might ensue in the markets.</p><p>To Dimon it was a terrifying predicament that caused his mind to spin as he rushed home afterward. He was already more than two hours late for a dinner party that his wife, Judy, was hosting. He was embarrassed by his delay because the dinner was for the parents of their daughter&#x2019;s boyfriend, whom he was meeting for the fi rst time.</p><p>&#x201c;Honestly, I&#x2019;m never this late,&#x201d; he offered, hoping to elicit some sympathy.</p><p>Trying to avoid saying more than he should, still he dropped some hints about what had happened at the meeting. &#x201c;You know, I am not lying about how serious this situation is,&#x201d; Dimon told his slightly alarmed guests as he mixed himself a martini. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to read about it tomorrow in the papers.&#x201d;</p><p>As he promised, Saturday&#x2019;s papers prominently featured the dramatic news to which he had alluded. Leaning against the kitchen counter, Dimon opened the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>and read the headline of its lead story: &#x201c;Lehman Races Clock; Crisis Spreads.&#x201d;</p><p>Dimon knew that Lehman Brothers might not make it through the weekend. JP Morgan had examined its books earlier that week as a potential lender and had been unimpressed. He also had decided to request some extra collateral from the firm out of fear it might fall. In the next twenty four hours, Dimon knew, Lehman would either be rescued or ruined.</p><p>Knowing what he did, however, Dimon was concerned about more than just Lehman Brothers. He was aware that Merrill Lynch, another icon of Wall Street, was in trouble, too, and he had just asked his staff to make sure JP Morgan had enough collateral from that firm as well. And he was also acutely aware of new dangers developing at the global insurance giant American International Group (AIG) that so far had gone relatively unnoticed by the public&#x2014;it was his firm&#x2019;s client, and they were scrambling to raise additional capital to save it. By his estimation AIG had only about a week to find a solution, or it, too, could falter.</p><p>Of the handful of principals involved in the dialogue about the enveloping crisis&#x2014;the government included&#x2014;Dimon was in an especially unusual position. He had the closest thing to perfect, real-time information. That &#x201c;deal flow&#x201d; enabled him to identify the fraying threads in the fabric of the financial system, even in the safety nets that others assumed would save the day.</p><p>Dimon began contemplating a worst-case scenario, and at 7:30 a.m. he went into his home library and dialed into a conference call with two dozen members of his management team.</p><p>&#x201c;You are about to experience the most unbelievable week in America ever, and we have to prepare for the absolutely worst case,&#x201d; Dimon told his staff. &#x201c;We have to protect the firm. This is about our survival.&#x201d;</p><p>His staff listened intently, but no one was quite certain what Dimon was trying to say.</p><p>Like most people on Wall Street&#x2014;including Richard S. Fuld Jr., Lehman&#x2019;s CEO, who enjoyed one of the longest reigns of any of its leaders&#x2014;many of those listening to the call assumed that the government would intervene and prevent its failure. Dimon hastened to disabuse them of the notion.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s wishful thinking. There is no way, in my opinion, that Washington is going to bail out an investment bank. Nor should they,&#x201d; he said decisively. &#x201c;I want you all to know that this is a matter of life and death.</p><p>I&#x2019;m serious.&#x201d;</p><p>Then he dropped his bombshell, one that he had been contemplating for the entire morning. It was his ultimate doomsday scenario.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the drill,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;We need to prepare right now for Lehman Brothers fi ling.&#x201d; Then he paused. &#x201c;And for Merrill Lynch filing.&#x201d; He paused again. &#x201c;And for AIG fi ling.&#x201d; Another pause. &#x201c;And for Morgan Stanley filing.&#x201d; And after a final, even longer pause he added: &#x201c;And potentially for Goldman Sachs filing.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p><i>There was a collective gasp on the phone.</i></p><p>As Dimon had presciently warned in his conference call, the following days would bring a near collapse of the financial system, forcing a government rescue effort with no precedent in modern history. In a period of less than eighteen months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.</p><p>Trillions of dollars in wealth had vanished, and the financial landscape was entirely reconfigured. The calamity would definitively shatter some of the most cherished principles of capitalism. The idea that financial wizards had conjured up a new era of low-risk profits, and that American-style financial engineering was the global gold standard, was officially dead.</p><p>Reprinted by arrangement with Viking, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc., from Too Big to Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin.

But she's downright furious a few moments later when she overhears her now "ex" boyfriend bet hunky Calvin Morrisey that he can't take her home and bed her. In fact, she's so angry at them both that she lets Cal take her to dinner and decides to string him along until after her sisters' wedding. Minerva pegs Cal as a handsome "used car salesman of seducers." Cal thinks Minerva is a "cranky, starving, risk-averse statistician." But Minerva's hormones keep whispering "this one," although she knows the gorgeous Cal isn't the man for her practical, white-cotton-bra, several-pounds-over-thin, self. And Cal is blindsided by the lust he feels for the voluptuous, sensual woman he glimpses behind Min's actuary exterior. While Cal and Min struggle to deal with their mutual distrust and attraction, their friends and families try their best to interfere and direct the progression of the unlikely romantic connection.</p><p> <i>Bet Me</i> is unabashedly, irrepressibly romantic. In the wacky, wonderful world of Min and Cal, author Jennifer Crusie leaves no humorous situation unexplored--no potential comedic cauldron left unstirred--no hysterically funny complication left undeveloped. The reader is treated to a seemingly mismatched hero and heroine who fling caution to the winds to explore their unexpected attraction. The sexual tension is hot, the dialogue witty and wickedly sarcastic, and the supporting cast of secondary characters hilarious.

Kate Chase studied the scene through the window of her father&#x2019;s carriage, forgetting, for the moment, her misgivings that she was attending the event as a guest rather than playing hostess. The crush of people forced their horses to slow to a walk long before they reached the bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson in the center of the driveway, and the tall white columns of the front portico suddenly seemed to be an interminable distance away.</p><p>&#x201c;Father,&#x201d; Kate said, touching his hand where it rested on the black leather seat between them. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you say that the President and his wife had invited only Cabinet members, a few dignitaries, and their wives to tonight&#x2019;s dinner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wives, or daughters, as the case may be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or daughters,&#x201d; amended Kate, smiling. &#x201c;I ask because if the size of this crowd is any indication, it would seem that either you were misinformed, or the vast population of Washington City was.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I trust I didn&#x2019;t misunderstand the president&#x2019;s invitation,&#x201d; her father replied. &#x201c;No, my dear Katie, what you see before you is the capital&#x2019;s most persistent plague&#x2014;patronage seekers. They know they won&#x2019;t be allowed past the doorman tonight, but that won&#x2019;t stop them from clutching at the sleeves and pleading in the ears of any unfortunate official whom they can accost on the way to the door.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. &#x201c;Then we shall have to be quick and clever to avoid them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, and we&#x2019;ll keep the distance from carriage to threshold as short as possible.&#x201d; Salmon P. Chase frowned out the window. Impeded by the throng, the carriage had slowed to a crawl until it finally halted several yards away from the portico. &#x201c;Although that might prove difficult.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mr. Secretary,&#x201d; the driver called down. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get any closer until those other drivers clear away.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate had no desire to spend any more of that lovely spring evening gazing longingly at the brightly lit White House through a carriage window and imagining all she was missing within. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s brave the gauntlet,&#x201d; she proposed. &#x201c;The president and his wife are expecting us.&#x201d;</p><p>Her father nodded, more impatient than she to join the gathering inside. He deplored tardiness and did not tolerate it in himself or anyone else. &#x201c;This will do, George,&#x201d; he called to the driver. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll walk from here.&#x201d;</p><p>Her father helped her down from the carriage, and as she took his arm, she felt a glow of warmth and happiness fill her heart despite the small, sad ache of disappointment that had nagged her ever since the Republican party had selected Mr. Lincoln rather than her father as its candidate. If not for the perfidy of the delegates from his own state of Ohio, her father surely would have been sworn in as president earlier that month rather than Secretary of the Treasury, and Kate, as the widower&#x2019;s eldest daughter, would have become First Lady.</p><p>Salmon P. Chase was, Kate knew to the very core of her being, the better man&#x2014;better educated than Mr. Lincoln, more experienced, more committed to the noble cause of abolition, and vastly more qualified. Father had been a senator and governor, while Mr. Lincoln&#x2014;well, Kate liked him, but if she set sentiment aside and forced herself to be strictly objective, she had no choice but to admit that a kindly country lawyer from the West with but one term in Congress to his credit was ill prepared to steer the ship of state, especially through the rough waters the nation faced. Any observer could see that, and in fact, many had, and had said so in the streets and in the press. No one expected much of the new president, and they expected even less of his overeager, overanxious wife, a matron in her mid-forties who had thus far failed to make a favorable impression on Washington&#x2019;s social elite.</p><p>Fortunately, Mr. Lincoln would have Salmon P. Chase to advise him. As for Mrs. Lincoln, for the good of the nation and the Republican party, some kind lady ought to befriend her, become her confidante, and help her navigate the thorny maze of Washington society.</p><p>Kate resigned herself to the likelihood that no one was better suited for the role than herself, though she was more than twenty years younger than Mrs. Lincoln.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Secretary,&#x201d; a voice rang out. Glancing to her left, Kate glimpsed a freckled young man in a brown suit two sizes too large for his bony frame, waving a handful of papers and grinning hopefully. &#x201c;Mr. Secretary, a moment of your time, if you please.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s no one,&#x201d; Kate murmured, not unkindly. Her father was terribly nearsighted, but he hated to wear his spectacles in public and often relied upon Kate to identify people at a distance. He had been known to pass good friends and acquaintances on the sidewalks or halls of Congress without recognizing them, an unfortunate habit that contributed to his reputation as being aloof and uncongenial.</p><p>As other eager, avaricious faces turned their way, Father offered Kate his arm. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s make haste.&#x201d;</p><p>Quickly Kate slipped her hand into the crook of his elbow and hurried off beside him. &#x201c;Perhaps you should throw a few minor treasury appointments after us to distract them,&#x201d; she teased, breathless. &#x201c;Rather like Aphrodite&#x2019;s golden apples, but in reverse.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have no Hippomenes catch my Atalanta,&#x201d; her father declared, quickening his pace as he guided her through the crowd. Laughing, Kate did her best to keep up with him, though she was shorter than her father by nearly half a foot and encumbered by her corset and hoopskirt.</p><p>At last they reached the portico, where the burly, white-haired doorman greeted them in an Irish brogue and admitted them into the vestibule. They passed through the main hall into the Blue Room, a graceful ellipse with tall windows overlooking the south lawn and the Potomac River. It seemed to Kate to be in better repair than the other public rooms of the executive mansion, which were shabbily furnished with threadbare and tobacco-stained rugs, broken furniture, torn wallpaper, and ruined draperies, from which souvenir collectors had snipped pieces until they hung in tatters. Here, however, all was in elegant order. The chairs and settees were upholstered in rich blue and silver damask, the woodwork brilliantly gilded. Ornate mirrors on the marble mantel reflected the light from the chandeliers hanging high above from a frescoed ceiling of cerulean blue, beneath which men of influence clad in evening black and their ladies in elegant gowns of every hue mingled and chatted, the soft blue-and-white carpet muffling their footsteps.</p><p>Before passing from the brightly lit hall into the Blue Room, the Chases paused in the doorway, long enough for almost thirty pairs of eyes to turn their way. Conversations paused as the guests took in the newcomers, and as Kate smiled warmly and nodded gracefully to one acquaintance after another, she drew herself up proudly, knowing how she and her father looked to them. Salmon P. Chase&#x2014;tall, broad- shouldered, and powerfully built, his features strong and regular beneath a high, clear brow projecting intelligence, courage, and dignity&#x2014;was the very image of a statesman. And Kate herself&#x2014;auburn haired, her green eyes flecked with hazel, young, slender, vivacious, becomingly attired in a gown of pale yellow silk, her hair arranged in a simple, elegant twist and adorned with white flowers&#x2014;was the very ideal of the accomplished, dutiful daughter. &#x201c;You look like the king and queen of Washington,&#x201d; her younger sister, Nettie, had sighed wistfully upon their departure from home. Father had taken a moment to lecture his youngest child on the superiority of American democracy to European monarchy, which she accepted with a good-natured shrug, with none of the shame and remorse Father&#x2019;s admonishments evoked in Kate.</p><p>As John Nicolay, the president&#x2019;s private secretary, made the customary introductions, Father escorted Kate across the room where</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln waited to receive their guests. The president&#x2019;s gaunt features became warmer, his eyes brighter, when he smiled, as he did when he shook Father&#x2019;s hand and then Kate&#x2019;s. &#x201c;How is little Nettie?&#x201d; Mr. Lincoln asked, his thick, dark brows rising quizzically, an amusing complement to the high, thin quality of his voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Very well, thank you,&#x201d; Father replied formally, bowing to Mrs. Lincoln.</p><p>Seeing her father and the president together, Kate almost laughed aloud, taken anew by the remarkable distinction between them. If Father looked every inch a statesman, Mr. Lincoln resembled a frontier schoolmaster with no wife to remind him to brush his hair and straighten his coat. &#x201c;Nettie is indeed well,&#x201d; she amended her father&#x2019;s reply, &#x201c;but I confess she was disappointed to be left at home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you bring her along?&#x201d; Mr. Lincoln asked, genuinely perplexed.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Mr. Lincoln,&#x201d; his wife chided him, laughing shortly. Her eyes were sharply blue, her complexion white and smooth, her neck and arms elegantly molded, but she was otherwise plain and tended toward stoutness, which her short stature and her husband&#x2019;s great height unfortunately exaggerated. &#x201c;Children, at a state dinner for the Cabinet? Not even Tad and Willie will be in attendance tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Lincoln smiled benignly down upon his wife. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fortunate to have you here to remind me of such things.&#x201d; He turned back to the Chases with a self-deprecating shrug. &#x201c;When I consider the reams of paper piled upon my desk, which are almost certainly accumulating greater heights even as we speak, I can only hope that an instructive book on presidential manners lies at the bottom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At the very bottom, do you mean?&#x201d; teased Kate, detecting an ironic note in his tone. &#x201c;So deeply buried that no one can expect you to unearth and to read it?&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Lincoln&#x2019;s laugh rang out, rich and full. &#x201c;Why, yes, Miss Chase. You understand me perfectly.&#x201d;</p><p>Father beamed proudly, but as she took Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s hand, Kate detected a flicker of annoyance in the First Lady&#x2019;s eyes above her gracious smile, and she was not sorry to move on. There were wives and daughters to befriend, gentlemen to charm, and people of influence to impress, but as she and her father made their way around the room, Kate often thought she still felt Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s blue eyes upon her, taking her measure with scrupulous, unforgiving precision.</p><p>Kate soon forgot Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s displeasure, swept up in the pleasure of making new acquaintances and engaging in lively conversation that occasionally, and rather delightfully, leaned toward debate. United States Attorney General Edward Bates, black-haired and white bearded, spoke longingly and endearingly of the Missouri home he had only recently departed, while General Simon Cameron, with his keen, deep-set eyes and thin mouth, struck her as insistent and shrewd. One by one Kate addressed them all, and the ladies who had accompanied them, complimenting their attire and inquiring about their children. Kate especially liked the wife of the Secretary of State, Frances Seward, whose dark, intelligent eyes belied the frailty of her form. Unfortunately, Mrs. Seward spent little time in Washington City, preferring her gracious family home and more temperate climate of Auburn, New York&#x2014;but her frequent absence, and that of the vice- president&#x2019;s wife, did leave Kate the second highest-ranking woman of the Executive Branch according to protocol and tradition, behind Mrs. Lincoln, who never let her forget it.</p><p>A moment came when Kate found herself unaccompanied, but just as it occurred to her that they should have been called in to dinner by then, Mrs. Lincoln appeared at her side. &#x201c;Dinner will be delayed somewhat longer,&#x201d; the First Lady explained, drawing her apart from the others. &#x201c;General Scott has not yet arrived.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, of course we must wait for him,&#x201d; Kate replied. &#x201c;I hope he wasn&#x2019;t swallowed up in the crush outside.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he wasn&#x2019;t. A crowd of patronage-seekers is no match for a gentleman who commands entire armies.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be careful what you say in this city, even in jest,&#x201d; Mrs. Lincoln cautioned, linking her arm through Kate&#x2019;s and strolling away from the other guests so that Kate was compelled to come along. &#x201c;Rumors fly so swiftly in Washington that if I were to cross this room right now, I would not be surprised if the people on the other side greeted me with the dreadful news that General Scott met his demise at the hands of a mob on our front doorstep.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate laughed easily. &#x201c;Thank you for the warning. I&#x2019;ll take heed, I assure you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Speaking of rumors.&#x201d; Mrs. Lincoln halted, slipped her arm free from Kate&#x2019;s, and fixed her with an inscrutable look. &#x201c;You do know the rumors circulating about us, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why, no,&#x201d; said Kate. &#x201c;Why should there be any rumors about you and me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because people enjoy gossip even more than they relish believing that accomplished women cannot get along.&#x201d; Mrs. Lincoln smiled, but she glanced past Kate&#x2019;s shoulder as if wary that they would be overheard. &#x201c;They say that you and I are embroiled in a terrible feud.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate was so astonished she laughed. &#x201c;And what reason do they give for it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My overwhelming jealousy at the attentions my husband showed you at the military ball given in his honor when we stopped in Columbus in February on our way to Washington.&#x201d; Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s smile tightened as she nodded to a cabinet official passing nearby. &#x201c;They say he danced with you more often than was seemly and showered you in compliments, while I looked on, weeping by some accounts and seething according to others.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s nonsense,&#x201d; Kate exclaimed, quickly lowering her voice. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t even in Columbus when your train passed through.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why, no, you weren&#x2019;t, were you?&#x201d; mused Mrs. Lincoln as if she had only just remembered&#x2014;although an edge to her voice immediately told Kate that the perceived slight had been in the forefront of her thoughts all evening. &#x201c;You knew the president-elect and his wife and sons would be passing through your own city, and yet some urgent business of far greater importance compelled you away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not of greater importance, but essential nonetheless.&#x201d; Kate drew herself up to her full height and regarded the first lady steadily. &#x201c;Governor Dennison had appointed my father a state delegate to the Peace Convention. My family had already come to Washington City by the time you reached Columbus, or I would have been there to meet you. I trust Governor Dennison&#x2019;s wife welcomed you as well as I would have done.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s smiled deepened and hardened. &#x201c;Or better, perhaps. Almost certainly better.&#x201d;</p><p>With that, she moved off in a swirl of silk skirts, leaving Kate watching after her, utterly astonished.</p><p>Soon thereafter, word came that General Scott was ill and would not be able to join them after all. Mr. Nicolay signaled for the Marine</p><p>Band to strike up a spirited march, and as the brisk, merry tune played, Kate quickly composed herself, found ...</p></p><h2>The Vegan Scoop: 150 Recipes for Dairy-Free Ice Cream that Tastes Better Than the &#34;Real&#34; Thing</h2><p><p></p><p><i>The Vegan Scoop</i> brings the pleasures of the ice cream parlor into your home with 150 recipes for delicious frozen desserts that are so rich and creamy, they&#x2019;re better than the &#x201c;real&#x201d; thing&#x2014;and contain one-third the calories! </p><p></p><p></p><p><br> Developed by vegan hipster Wheeler del Torro of Wheeler&#x2019;s Frozen Desserts, these &#x201c;faux&#x201d; creams feature 100 percent vegan-certified ingredients, making them suitable for both vegans and those with lactose intolerance and other dairy aversions.

Then a sudden misfortune turns her life upside down, and Sara is banished to the school's dreary attic and must work for her living. It takes all of Sara's imagination and a little bit of magic to turn her misfortune around and prove she is, at heart, a little princess. </p><p>Frances Hodgson Burnett's story of how Sara Crewe survives hardship and finds happiness again was originally published in 1905 and has won the hearts of children the world over.

Even as a young child, her greatest pleasure was in making up stories and acting them out, using her dolls as characters. She wrote over forty books, including the classic <em>A Little Princess</em>, also illustrated by Tasha Tudor.</p></p><h2>The End of Stress as We Know It</h2><p>McEwen (neuroendocrinology researcher, Rockefeller U., New York City) draws on extensive research, including his own, to explain the role of stress (or &#34;allostatic load&#34;) in our lives and how to use it to good effect rather than be injured by it. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>There's a whole new way to think about stress. Sure, some stress is inevitable, but being "stressed out" isn't. In fact, we can learn to rechannel the powerful stress activators in our lives to make us even more effective. <br><br>Hamlet spoke of "suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune." These days we simply use the word "stress" to describe that feeling. And if you ask 10 random people if they feel stressed, chances are that at least 9 will reply with a resounding, "Yes!" Indeed, the very way we use the word implies that we are its victims&#x2014;as in, "I'm under so much stress" or "I'm completely stressed out." There&#x2019;s now a better way to look at this picture, a way to move from victim to victor. The first step is to look to the science behind it all because in the science lies a whole new message about stress. Science allows us to understand what the stress response is and why our bodies react the way they do. Like all living creatures, we're mapped to respond instinctually in certain ways, and generally for good reasons. We know, for example, that in times of emergency, we effortlessly shift into a different biological mode. Based on our perception of the crisis, our brains initiate the "stress response" or the "flight-or-fight reaction." Our attention becomes keenly focused. Our heart and lungs accelerate to ready us for action. Our glands mobilize extra energy resources and summon the immune system to battle stations. This whole process is Nature's way of empowering us to respond swiftly, sometimes dramatically, to sudden events, while remaining mentally alert and physically prepared to meet a challenge. <br><br>But what if the crisis situation does not present us with a foe to be fought? Or if fleeing is not the answer? Too often in modern times, the situations that bring on the stress response require neither the fight nor flight response for which our bodies are genetically programmed. The stress response is nevertheless likely to kick in&#x2014;just as it's programmed to do&#x2014;even though it cannot help speed us toward a resolution. Deprived of its natural successful result, the very system that&#x2019;s designed to protect us begins to cause wear and tear on our bodies&#x2014;actually bringing on illnesses as diverse and severe as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, ulcers, and increased susceptibility to colds and infections. <br><br>The good news is that there are definite things that we can do to prevent this process from ultimately taking this wrong turn. New research in brain functioning allows us to understand the reactions our bodies have to various stressful circumstances. That knowledge is power&#x2014;the power to harness the energy stored within us and to channel it in positive ways. <b>The End of Stress as We Know It</b> leads us to a new appreciation of the mind&#x2013;body connection so that we learn how to reduce stress and increase our overall sense of health and well-being&#x2014;and even turn aside the slings and arrows of life.<br><br><i>Co-published with the Dana Press.</i>"You think you know what stress is, but not like you will after you've read The End of Stress as We Know It. Bruce McEwen, arguably the world's most renowned expert on the biology of stress, tells you everything you need to know, including ways of dealing with stress. It's very informative, and a great read." -- Joseph LeDoux, Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, NYU, and author of Synaptic Self and The Emotional Brain <p>"Famed stress researcher Bruce McEwen draws on a vast amount of research (much of it his own) to explain in everyday language everything you need to know in order to make your life less stressful. Most encouraging are his suggestions for transforming unavoidable stresses into challenges, and his finding that 'a healthy attitude can confer a high degree of protection and resilience, despite one&#x2019;s circumstances.'" -- Richard Restak, M.D., author of Secret Life of the Brain and Mozart's Brain and the Fighter Pilot </p><p>"This is a rare and delightful kind of book. It is serious science, the psychology and biology of stress, explained by a leading neuroscientist. But it is also engaging and accessible, and it reads like a novel. If one wants to explore the legitimate science of this area, and also understand it, this is the book to read." -- Larry R. Squire, Professor of Psychiatry, Neurosciences, and Psychology at the University of California, San Diego, and Career Research Scientist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Diego </p><p>"Bruce McEwen's book tells us how thoughts and emotions get into the body to influence health. This outstanding scholar gives us a grand tour of the world of stress, based on the author&#x2019;s groundbreaking research; he tells us what stress does to us and how we can keep ourselves from being stressed out. An outstanding volume by a premier researcher, he is articulate and entertaining.

Perhaps lose weight, find your perfect partner, obtain your dream job, or simply be happier? Try this simple exercise. . . .<br><br>Close your eyes and imagine the new you. Think how great you would look in those close-fitting designer jeans, dating Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie, sitting in a luxurious leather chair at the top of the corporate ladder, or sipping a pi�a colada as the warm waves of the Caribbean gently lap at your feet.<br><br>The good news is that this type of exercise has been recommended by some in the self-help industry for years. The bad news is that a large body of research now suggests that such exercises are, at best, ineffective and, at worst, harmful. Although imagining your perfect self may make you feel better, engaging in such mental escapism can also have the unfortunate side effect of leaving you unprepared for the difficulties that crop up on the rocky road to success, thus increasing the chances of your faltering at the first hurdle rather than persisting in the face of failure. Fantasizing about heaven on earth may put a smile on your face, but it is unlikely to help transform your dreams into reality.<br><br>Other research suggests that the same goes for many popular techniques that claim to improve your life. Attempting to &#x201c;think yourself happy&#x201d; by suppressing negative thoughts can make you obsess on the very thing that makes you unhappy. Group brainstorming can produce fewer and less original ideas than individuals working alone. Punching a pillow and screaming out loud can increase, rather than decrease, your anger and stress levels.<br><br>Then there is the infamous &#x201c;Yale Goal Study.&#x201d; According to some writers, in 1953 a team of researchers interviewed Yale&#x2019;s graduating seniors, asking them whether they had written down the specific goals that they wanted to achieve in life. Twenty years later the researchers tracked down the same cohort and found that the 3 percent of people who had specific goals all those years before had accumulated more personal wealth than the other 97 percent of their classmates combined.<br><br>It is a great story, frequently cited in self-help books and seminars to illustrate the power of goal setting. There is just one small problem&#x2014;as far as anyone can tell, the experiment never actually took place. In 2007 writer Lawrence Tabak, from the magazine <i>Fast Company</i>, attempted to track down the study, contacting several writers who had cited it, the secretary of the Yale Class of 1953, and other researchers who had tried to discover whether the study had actually happened. No one could produce any evidence that it had ever been conducted, causing Tabak to conclude that it was almost certainly nothing more than an urban myth. For years, selfhelp gurus had been happy to describe a study without checking their facts.<br><br>Both the public and the business world have bought into modern-day mind myths for years and, in so doing, may have significantly decreased the likelihood of achieving their aims and ambitions. Worse still, such failure often encourages people to believe that they cannot control their lives. This is especially unfortunate, as even the smallest loss of perceived control can have a dramatic effect on people&#x2019;s confidence, happiness, and life span. In one classic study conducted by Ellen Langer at Harvard University, half of the residents in a nursing home were given a houseplant and asked to look after it, while the other residents were given an identical plant but told that the staff would take responsibility for it. Six months later, the residents who had been robbed of even this small amount of control over their lives were significantly less happy, healthy, and active than the others. Even more distressing, 30 percent of the residents who had not looked after their plant had died, compared to 15 percent of those who had been allowed to exercise such control. Similar results have been found in many areas, including education, career, health, relationships, and dieting. The message is clear&#x2014;those who do not feel in control of their lives are less successful, and less psychologically and physically healthy, than those who do feel in control.<br><br>A few years ago I was having lunch with a friend named Sophie. Sophie is a bright, successful thirtysomething who holds a senior position in a firm of management consultants. Over lunch Sophie explained that she had recently bought a well-known book on increasing happiness, and she asked me what I thought of the industry. I explained that I had serious reservations about the scientific backing for some of the techniques being promoted, and described how any failure to change could do considerable psychological harm. Sophie looked concerned and then asked whether academic psychology had produced more scientifically supported ways of improving people&#x2019;s lives. I started to describe some of the quite complex academic work in happiness, and after about fifteen minutes or so Sophie stopped me. She politely explained that interesting though it was, she was a busy person, and she asked whether I could come up with some effective advice that didn&#x2019;t take quite so much time to implement. I asked how long I had. Sophie glanced at her watch, smiled, and replied, &#x201c;About a minute?&#x201d;<br><br>Sophie&#x2019;s comment made me stop and think. Many people are attracted to self-development and self-improvement because of the lure of quick and easy solutions to various issues in their lives. Unfortunately, most academic psychology either fails to address these issues or presents far more time-consuming and complex answers (thus the scene in Woody Allen&#x2019;s film <i>Sleeper</i>, in which Allen&#x2019;s character discovers that he has awakened two hundred years in the future, sighs, and explains that had he been in therapy all this time he would almost be cured). I wondered whether there were tips and techniques hidden away in academic journals that were empirically supported but quick to carry out.<br><br>Over the course of a few months I carefully searched through endless journals containing research papers from many different areas of psychology. As I examined the work, a promising pattern emerged, with researchers in quite different fields developing techniques that help people achieve their aims and ambitions in minutes, not months. I collected hundreds of these studies, drawn from many different areas of the behavioral sciences. From mood to memory, persuasion to procrastination, resilience to relationships, together they represent a new science of rapid change.<br><br>There is a very old story, often told to fill time during training courses, involving a man trying to fix his broken boiler.<br>Despite his best efforts over many months, he simply can&#x2019;t mend it. Eventually, he gives up and decides to call in an expert. The engineer arrives, gives one gentle tap on the side of the boiler, and stands back as it springs to life. The engineer presents the man with a bill, and the man argues that he should pay only a small fee as the job took the engineer only a few moments. The engineer quietly explains that the man is not paying for the time he took to tap the boiler but rather the years of experience involved in knowing exactly where to tap. Just like the expert engineer tapping the boiler, the techniques described in this book demonstrate that effective change does not have to be time-consuming. In fact, it can take less than a minute and is often simply a question of knowing exactly where to tap.</p><h2>Open Secret: Versions of Rumi</h2><p>Jelaluddin Rumi (1207-1273) is considered by most to be the greatest of the Sufi mystical poets and one of the most highly regarded saints from any tradition.</p><p>Coleman Barks, Professor Emeritus at the University of Georgia, is Rumi's premier English translator.

In 1985, while at the height of his success as a conductor and BBC music producer, a virus completely destroyed the memory part of his brain, leaving him trapped in a limbo of the constant present where every conscious moment was as if he had just woken from a ten-year coma. For seven years he was kept in the general ward of a London hospital while his wife Deborah campaigned for better conditions and searched hopelessly for a cure. As damaged as Clive was, the musical part of his brain was unaffected, as was his passionate love for Deborah.<br><br>Finding there was no way to bring Clive back, Deborah eventually fled to America to start her life again. Then, miraculously, in their transatlantic phone calls she noticed Clive starting to recover some of his memory, and she was pulled back to England. Today, although he still lives in care, they are closer than ever.<br><br>This is the story of an extreme condition that is a reminder of what it means to be human. It is also a woman&#x2019;s quest to understand, control, and escape from a nightmare. Finally, it is insight into a bond that runs deeper than conscious thought, a love overcoming the most tragic handicap.</p><p>Deborah Wearing campaigned for ten years for special medical services for the brain-damaged, and founded The Amnesia Association. She now combines writing with her work as an administrator for Britain&#x2019;s National Health Service.&#34;This is a harrowing, haunting and heartening book - a loss-story which is also a love story.

Perhaps it is less a book about the American land than some ruminations about the making of America. . . . We are the unfinished product of a long becoming."<br> &#x2014;from <i>American Places</i> <br><br> "The text by the Stegners is precise, to the point, packed with useful information and infused with that love for our land and its honest workers which is the highest form (perhaps the only form) of patriotism."<br> &#x2014;Edward Abbey<b>Wallace Stegner</b> was born in 1909 in Lake Mills, Iowa. The son of Scandinavian immigrants, he traveled with his parents and brother all over the West-to North Dakota, Washington, Saskatchewan, Montana, and Wyoming-before settling in Salt Lake City in 1921. Many of the landscapes he encountered in his peripatetic youth figure largely in his work, as do characters based on his stern father and athletic, outgoing brother. Stegner received most of his education in Utah, graduating from the University in 1930. He furthered his education at the University of Iowa, where he received a master's and a doctoral degree. He married Mary Stuart Page in 1934, and for the next decade the couple followed Wallace's teaching career-to the University of Wisconsin, Harvard, and eventually to Stanford University, where he founded the creative writing program, and where he was to remain until his retirement in 1971. A number of his creative writing students have become some of today's most well respected writers, including Wendell Berry, Thomas McGuane, Raymond Carver, Edward Abbey, Robert Stone, and Larry McMurty.<p>Throughout his career and after, Stegner's literary output was tremendous. His first novel, Remembering Laughter, was published in 1937. By the time of his death in 1993 he had published some two dozen works of fiction, history, biography, and essays. Among his many literary prizes are the Pulitzer Prize for <b>Angle of Repose</b> (1971) and the National Book Award for <b>The Spectator Bird </b>(1976). His collection of essays, <b>Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs</b> (1992), was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle award.</p><p>Although his fiction deals with many universal themes, Stegner is primarily recognized as a writer of the American West. Much of his literature deals with debunking myths of the West as a romantic country of heroes on horseback, and his passion for the terrain and its inhabitants have earned him the title 'The Dean of Western Letters'. He was one of the few true Men of Letters in this generation. An historian, essayist, short story writer and novelist, as well as a leading environmental writer. Although always connected in people's minds with the West, he had a long association with New England. Many short stories and one of his most successful novels, Crossing to Safety, are set in Vermont, where he had a summer home for many years. Another novel, <b>The Spectator Bird</b>, takes place in Denmark.</p><p>An early environmentalist, he actively championed the region's preservation and was instrumental-with his now-famous 'Wilderness Letter'-in the passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act. Honest and straightforward, educated yet unpretentious, cantankerous yet compassionate, <b>Wallace Stegner</b> was an enormous presence in the American literary landscape, a man who wrote and lived with ferocity, energy, and integrity.</p><p><b>Page Stegner</b> is a Professor Emeritus of American Literature at the University of California at Santa Cruz.</p></p><h2>The Word of God and the Word of Man (Harper Torchbooks: The Cloister Library)</h2><p>A translation of &#34;Das Wort Gottes und die Theologie.&#34; Translated with a new Foreword by Douglas Horton.</p><p></p><h2>Blue Willow</h2><p>Janey Larkin can&#39;t remember when she&#39;s lived in the same place for more than a year.

In five-minute vignettes, she managed to convey the essential New York City: life in a high rise apartment building (the last small town in America); annals of Chester-the-Sheepdog, Duke, the German shepherd, and their friends; the tree-lighting, magic and music of Christmas in New York. We meet Arlene, Hanff&#39;s high-flying friend who&#39;s social life (and wardrobe) put Hanff&#39;s one-and-one-half room apartment and simple writer&#39;s life in perspective. We walk through Nina&#39;s garden, 16 stories up and witness famous New York rites of passage from the hysteria of St. Patrick&#39;s Day to Shakespeare&#39;s Garden and the neighbors who saved it, to block parties, with their sizzling Italian sausages and shish kebab and flossy plates of pate and brie, all told in Hanff&#39;s inimitable style. We join Hanff as she flies to London to realize a lifetime dream at the Ambassador Theatre: opening night for the play, 84, Charing Cross Road. And we witness the elegant Arlene as she meets and falls in love with a New York City cop.</p><p>Helene Hanff is the author of APPLE OF MY EYE, THE DUCHESS OF BLOOMSBURY STREET, LETTER FROM NEW YORK, Q&#39;S LEGACY and UNDERFOOT IN SHOW BUSINESS. She wrote a number of books for young readers the best known being MOVERS AND SHAKERS and TERRIBLE THOMAS. Born in Philadelphia, Helene lived most of her life in New York City.In 1978, Hanff, author of the charming 84, Charing Cross Road ( LJ 9/1/70) and Q's Legacy ( LJ 7/85), began recording a five-minute monthly broadcast about her life in New York City for a popular BBC radio show called "Woman's Hour." Gathered here in this slim volume are six years worth of Hanff's observances; her brief vignettes run the gamut of the Big Apple experience, from an unforgettable party for 18 people in a tiny studio apartment to the magic of a New York Christmas and the glories of a Central Park summer. While jaded New Yorkers and others familiar with the city may find her anecdotes a bit simplistic and, at times, outdated, rabid Hanff fans will find her enthusiasm for her adopted city irresistible.

Rather than pumping a "get rich quick" approach to selling, the author shows brokers that they don&#x2019;t have to sacrifice integrity and ethics to remain competitive and deal oriented. The book includes detailed coverage of </p><p>� Choosing a company and a specialty that&#x2019;s a good fit for you. <br>� Sales strategies and sales points specific to commercial real estate, including practical suggestions for countering other brokers. <br>� The importance of focusing on exclusive listings, how to find and get the best prospects, and the most effective strategies for marketing the property. <br>� Standard parts and points of negotiation for contracts and forms, including earnest money agreements, leases, options, listings, counter offers, and fee schedules. <br>� Rent and how it is calculated and quoted, including triple net, modified net, gross, and full service leases. <br>� Technical knowledge including agency, law, appraisal, taxation, zoning, surveys, environmental investigations, investment analysis, risk comparison, exchanges, financing, and property management. <br>�The pros and cons of going independent and how to decide if it&#x2019;s the right move for you. </p><p>Written in an engaging, straight-talk style, the author shares a wealth of other practical knowledge reaped from 30 years in the business.</p></p><p>John Bowman has been active in commercial real estate for more than 30 years as a salesman, broker, or manager for more than 30 years. He started in his family&#x2019;s commercial real estate company, Bowman Company, located in Portland, Oregon, where he became sales manager, president, and a part owner. In 1983 Bowman Company joined forces with Portland&#x2019;s largest commercial firm, Norris, Beggs and Simpson, where the author spent 10 years as an industrial broker. He started his own commercial real estate company, John L. Bowman, Realtor� in 1992. He was a member of the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors�, president of the SIOR Oregon Chapter, member of the SIOR national board of directors, and board member of the Oregon and Southwest Washington Commercial Association of Realtors�. He has also served on various association committees including Professional Standards. <p>The author specialized in industrial real estate, but has had experience in all areas of the business. He has done real estate deals in office, retail, and investments and is also experienced in land sales, high-tech, and exchanges. He has also had experience managing commercial real estate sales people and operating a commercial real estate office. The author has represented many national companies in their real estate dealings including General Electric, Westinghouse, Coca-Cola, and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.</p>The book is written in plain English, with insight only an experienced professional can bring to the table, and with a little tongue-in-cheek humor. Following are some excerpts; <p>* "Industrial historically has been where the "real men" go..." * "Some brokers think marketing commercial real estate means putting an ad in the classifieds, and then putting their feet up and aggressively waiting for the phone to ring." * "Office brokers wear nice suits with a hanky in the pocket. They typically are smoother than industrial brokers..." * "High tech brokers are a little schizophrenic. They are not quite industrial brokers and not quite office brokers." * "The "after deal", "second" round, or "contingency" negotiations...[often occur]... when a purchase agreement has a contingency for such things as an environmental analysis or engineering inspection, which indicate that there are some problems with the property...[these are]... a second set of negotiations...[which]...are entirely legitimate...because the seller will be faced with the same cost if they sell it or not. They also will, most likely, have to face the same issue with a future buyer." * "Investment brokers are the computer hackers of the commercial real estate business. They spend much of their time hunched over computers, manipulating numbers and working on investment analyses or spreadsheets." * "Thomas Hobbes once said that human life was &#x2018;...solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short&#x2019;. Analogously, those who do not succeed in commercial real estate often lead desperate and solitary lives in poverty with careers that are nasty, brutish and short. A career in commercial real estate can be wonderful for those that are doing well. They make money, get recognition, feel productive and lead purposeful careers. It is almost like a religion that gives focus and meaning to life, without the salvation. But, unfortunately, for those that struggle, the religion also has a hell. This book has been written to help the sinners avoid that hell." * "Forget small slights or injustices due to others behavior. Remember Albert Sweitzer&#x2019;s prescription for happiness, which is good health and a bad memory."</p></p><h2>Baffert Dirt Road to the Derby</h2><p>Baffert offers a frank-and frankly funny-portrayal of his border town roots and rapid rise to the top of the Sport of Kings. A riveting and revealing tale of what it takes to become America&#39;s No. 1 trainer.</p><p>Winning the Kentucky Derby two years in a row has made Bob Baffert the most visible trainer in America. His wit and silver-haired good looks have made him the most popular. Luck and charm have played a role in Baffert's meteoric rise to the top. But he also is acknowledged as a consummate horseman. <p> In his candid and often hilarious autobiography, "Dirt Road to the Derby", Baffert recounts growing up in a tiny Arizona border town, where he peddled eggs after school and started riding his families Quarter Horses. His early exploits as a jockey provide a fascinating glimpse of racing at the "bush tracks" of the Southwest, complete with shoot-outs and rigged races. After college and a fitful start as a Quarter Horse trainer, Baffert finally hits the big time in that sport. </p><p> But his real adventures begin when he strikes up a friendship with Mike Pegram, who bankrolled his entry into Thoroughbred racing. After losing the 1996 Kentucky Derby by a whisker, Baffert vows to return. The very next year, he achieves celebrity when he wins the Run for the Roses with the modestly bred Silver Charm. In 1998, he does it again with Real Quiet, who cost him just $17,000. </p><p> The Charm and a cast of other good horses take Baffert to the peak of his profession. He is in demand as a trainer by the richest and most influential people in racing. "Although I always wanted to be the best, I never dreamed of getting to where I am now," he writes. "I was just some kid from Arizona who couldn't even put a halter on a horse. To dream of attaining what I have would be like someone dreaming of becoming president." </p><p> Despite his success, which includes winning two Eclipse Awards as outstanding trainer, Baffert retains his sense of humor and fun-loving ways. "Dirt Road to the Derby" will make you laugh out loud.

Her writing appears in The Rolling Stone Book of Women in Rock and Traditions: New York, among other books. She has also written for a variety of publications, including Rolling Stone, The New York Times, The Oxford American, and the Village Voice.Jottings and spottings from more than 60 writers, artists, academics, and pop-culture sages, most of them contributors to Rolling Stone magazine, that celebrate the romantic nihilism of the postwar Beat movement. The Beats were cool and don't we miss them, say Hunter S. Thompson, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, David Amram, and Carolyn Cassady (Neal's wife). The rumpled, pot-smoking, hard-drinking, pansexual trio of Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Jack Kerouac not only changed everything about American culture, according to Rolling Stone culture critics Greil Marcus, Mikal Gilmore, and Robert Palmer, but still informs a generation of snide, black-clad, biker-jacket-and-tight-pants rebels, represented in pointless essays from guitarist-turned-novelist Richard Hell, rocker Graham Parker, and actor Johnny Depp, who recalls that reading Howl ``left me babbling like an idiot, stunned that someone could regurgitate such honesty on paper.'' Some minor writings from the Big Three that were previously published in Rolling Stone (editor George-Warren proudly puffs the magazine as a promoter of Beat sensibilities) are lost among windy blasts of hagiography, no-longer-new journalism, and judgments that don't make much sense, such as Ginsberg buddy Michael McClure's revelation that the Beats were really ``the literary wing of the environmental movement.'' If it's hard to accept CUNY English professor John Tytells claim that Beat writing, abstract expressionist art, be-bop jazz, and Method acting are all manifestations of primal American rebelliousness, journalist Henry Cabot Beck assures us that Maynard G. Krebs, the feckless hipster played by actor Bob Denver in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, was not what the Beats were all about.

M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters; in France, the Prix M�dicis and the Prix Femina; in Austria, the State Prize for European Literature; and in 2004 he was named Commandeur de l&#39;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. His work has been translated into more than thirty languages. The author lives in London.And so, it had all begun, very precisely, on the morning of the 28th of January 1936, in Arkhangelsk. He had been invited to perform his first piano concerto with the local orchestra under Viktor Kubatsky; the two of them had also played his new cello sonata. It had gone well. The next morning he went to the railway station to buy a copy of <i>Pravda. </i>He had looked at the front page briefly, then turned to the next two. It was, as he would later put it, the most memorable day of his life. And a date he chose to mark each year until his death.<br><br>Except that&#x2014;as his mind obstinately argued back&#x2014;nothing ever begins as precisely as that. It began in different places, and in different minds. The true starting point might have been his own fame. Or his opera. Or it might have been Stalin, who, being infallible, was therefore responsible for everything. Or it could have been caused by something as simple as the layout of an orchestra. Indeed, that might finally be the best way of looking at it: a composer first denounced and humiliated, later arrested and shot, all because of the layout of an orchestra.<br><br>If it all began elsewhere, and in the minds of others, then perhaps he could blame Shakespeare, for having written <i>Macbeth. </i>Or Leskov for Russifying it into <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. </i>No, none of that. It was, self-evidently, his own fault for having written the piece that offended. It was his opera&#x2019;s fault for being such a success&#x2014;at home and abroad&#x2014;it had aroused the curiosity of the Kremlin. It was Stalin&#x2019;s fault because he would have inspired and approved the <i>Pravda </i>editorial&#x2014;perhaps even written it himself: there were enough grammatical errors to suggest the pen of one whose mistakes could never be corrected. It was also Stalin&#x2019;s fault for imagining himself a patron and connoisseur of the arts in the first place. He was known never to miss a performance of <i>Boris Godunov </i>at the Bolshoi. He was almost as keen on <i>Prince Igor </i>and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x2019;s <i>Sadko. </i>Why should Stalin not want to hear this acclaimed new opera, <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk</i>?<br><br>And so, the composer was instructed to attend a performance of his own work on the 26th of January 1936. Comrade Stalin would be there; also Comrades Molotov, Mikoyan and Zhdanov. They took their places in the government box. Which had the misfortune to be situated immediately above the percussion and the brass. Sections which in <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk </i>were not scored to behave in a modest and self-effacing fashion.<br><br>He remembered looking across from the director&#x2019;s box, where he was seated, to the government box. Stalin was hidden behind a small curtain, an absent presence to whom the other distinguished comrades would sycophantically turn, knowing that they were themselves observed. Given the occasion, both conductor and orchestra were understandably nervous. In the entr&#x2019;acte before Katerina&#x2019;s wedding, the woodwind and brass suddenly took it upon themselves to play more loudly than he had scored. And then it was like a virus spreading through each section. If the conductor noticed, he was powerless. Louder and louder the orchestra became; and every time the percussion and brass roared fortissimo beneath them&#x2014;loud enough to knock out windowpanes&#x2014;Comrades Mikoyan and Zhdanov would shudder theatrically, turn to the figure behind the curtain and make some mocking remark. When the audience looked up to the government box at the start of the fourth act, they saw that it had been vacated.<br><br> After the performance, he had collected his briefcase and gone straight to the Northern Station to catch the train for Arkhangelsk. He remembered thinking that the government box had been specially reinforced with steel plates, to protect its occupants against assassination. But that there was no such cladding to the director&#x2019;s box. He was not yet thirty, and his wife was five months pregnant at the time.<br> &nbsp;<br> 1936: he had always been superstitious about leap years. Like many people, he believed that they brought bad luck.<br><br> #<br><br> Those who did not know him, and who followed music only from a distance, probably imagined that this had been his first setback. That the brilliant nineteen-year-old whose First Symphony was quickly taken up by Bruno Walter, then by Toscanini and Klemperer, had known nothing but a clear, clean decade of success since that premiere in 1926. And such people, perhaps aware that fame often leads to vanity and self-importance, might open their <i>Pravda </i>and agree that composers could easily stray from writing the kind of music people wanted to hear. And further, since all composers were employed by the state, that it was the state&#x2019;s duty, if they offended, to intervene and draw them back into greater harmony with their audience. This sounded entirely reasonable, didn&#x2019;t it?<br><br>Except that they had practised sharpening their claws on his soul from the beginning: while he was still at the Conservatoire a group of Leftist fellow students had tried to have him dismissed and his stipend removed. Except that the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians and similar cultural organisations had campaigned from their inception against what he stood for; or rather, what they thought he stood for. They were determined to break the bourgeois stranglehold on the arts. So workers must be trained to become composers, and all music must be instantly comprehensible and pleasing to the masses. Tchaikovsky was decadent, and the slightest experimentation condemned as &#x201c;formalism.&#x201d;<br><br>Except that as early as 1929 he had been officially denounced, told that his music was &#x201c;straying from the main road of Soviet art,&#x201d; and sacked from his post at the Choreographic Technical College. Except that in the same year Misha Kvadri, the dedicatee of his First Symphony, became the first of his friends and associates to be arrested and shot.<br><br> Except that in 1932, when the Party dissolved the independent organisations and took charge of all cultural matters, this had resulted not in a taming of arrogance, bigotry and ignorance, rather in a systematic concentration of them. And if the plan to take a worker from the coal face and turn him into a composer of symphonies did not exactly come to pass, something of the reverse happened. A composer was expected to increase his output just as a coal miner was, and his music was expected to warm hearts just as a miner&#x2019;s coal warmed bodies. Bureaucrats assessed musical output as they did other categories of output; there were established norms, and deviations from those norms.<br> &nbsp;<br> #<br> &nbsp;<br> At Arkhangelsk railway station, opening <i>Pravda </i>with chilled fingers, he had found on page three a headline identifying and condemning deviance: muddle instead of music. He determined at once to return home via Moscow, where he would seek advice. On the train, as the frozen landscape passed, he reread the article for the fifth and sixth times. Initially, he had been shocked as much for his opera as for himself: after such a denunciation, <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk </i>could not possibly continue at the Bolshoi. For the last two years, it had been applauded everywhere&#x2014;from New York to Cleveland, from Sweden to Argentina. In Moscow and Leningrad, it had pleased not just the public and the critics, but also the political commissars. At the time of the 17th Party Congress its performances had been listed as part of the Moscow district&#x2019;s official output, which aimed to compete with the production quotas of the Donbass coal miners.<br><br>All this meant nothing now: his opera was to be put down like a yapping dog which had suddenly displeased its master. He tried to analyse the different elements of the attack as clearheadedly as possible. First, his opera&#x2019;s very success, especially abroad, was turned against it. Only a few months before, <i>Pravda </i>had patriotically reported the work&#x2019;s American premiere at the Metropolitan Opera. Now the same paper knew that <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk </i>had only succeeded outside the Soviet Union because it was &#x201c;non-political and confusing,&#x201d; and because it &#x201c;tickled the perverted taste of the bourgeois with its fidgety, neurotic music.&#x201d;<br><br>Next, and linked to this, was what he thought of as government-box criticism, an articulation of those smirks and yawns and sycophantic turnings towards the hidden Stalin. So he read how his music &#x201c;quacks and grunts and growls&#x201d;; how its &#x201c;nervous, convulsive and spasmodic&#x201d; nature derived from jazz; how it replaced singing with &#x201c;shrieking.&#x201d; The opera had clearly been scribbled down in order to please the &#x201c;effete,&#x201d; who had lost all &#x201c;wholesome taste&#x201d; for music, preferring &#x201c;a confused stream of sound.&#x201d; As for the libretto, it deliberately concentrated on the most sordid parts of Leskov&#x2019;s tale: the result was &#x201c;coarse, primitive and vulgar.&#x201d;<br><br>But his sins were political as well. So the anonymous analysis by someone who knew as much about music as a pig knows about oranges was decorated with those familiar, vinegar-soaked labels. Petit-bourgeois, formalist, Meyerholdist, Leftist. The composer had written not an opera but an anti-opera, with music deliberately turned inside out. He had drunk from the same poisoned source which produced &#x201c;Leftist distortion in painting, poetry, teaching and science.&#x201d; In case it needed spelling out&#x2014;and it always did&#x2014;Leftism was contrasted with &#x201c;real art, real science and real literature.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Those that have ears will hear,&#x201d; he always liked to say. But even the stone deaf couldn&#x2019;t fail to hear what &#x201c;Muddle Instead of Music&#x201d; was saying, and guess its likely consequences. There were three phrases which aimed not just at his theoretical misguidedness but at his very person. &#x201c;The composer apparently never considered the problem of what the Soviet audience looks for and expects in music.&#x201d; That was enough to take away his membership in the Union of Composers. &#x201c;The dan�ger of this trend to Soviet music is clear.&#x201d; That was enough to take away his ability to compose and perform. And finally: &#x201c;It is a game of clever ingenuity that may end very badly.&#x201d; That was enough to take away his life.</p><h2>The Message of the Qur&#39;an</h2><p>A fresh look at Muhammad Asad's classic English translation and explanation of the Qur'an is offered in this redesigned and updated edition of his work.

Best-selling authors Quin Sherrer and Ruthanne Garlock have both endured the pain of waiting for the return of prodigal children. Yet even as they gave each situation into the hands of the Lord, they did not wait passively, succumbing to fear and despair. Instead they battled for their children in prayer, waiting expectantly for Almighty God to intervene. And He did! Now they tell the parents of prodigals how to pray their prodigals home, and how the experience can draw parents into the arms of their heavenly Father and strengthen their bonds of love.</p><p>INSIDE FLAP: AUTHOR COMMENT: PUBLISHER&#39;S COMMENT:<b>Quin Sherrer | Niceville, Florida</b><br>Quin has written or co-authored 28 books, including the bestseller A Woman&#x2019;s Guide to Spiritual Warfare.

The only real remedy for deception and apostasy is a return to a true biblical foundation for Christian living.

Life changed radically for the 15-year-old narrator when the regime took control, turning lives and values upside down. Anyone with education was marked for death; the people of the cities were driven into the countryside to a life of forced agricultural labor under harsh conditions. Positions of responsibility were given to the uneducated and unskilled. As a matter of survival, Teeda learned to hide any sign of her previous education and urban way of life. Although her father was killed, the rest of her family managed to stay together, and her close family relationships sustained Teeda throughout her adolescence. The story of her escape is suspenseful, and the book is sure to hold the interest of teenagers. A fine addition to collections of Southeast Asian history and biography, and a good focus for the study of values. Rita G. Keeler, St. John's School, Houston<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.When the Khmer Rouge achieved victory in Cambodia (Kampuchea) in 1975, Teeda Butt Mam and her well-to-do family left Phnom Penh as the cities were cleared of all inhabitants. For the next four years Mam experienced constant fear, hunger, and deprivation. And death; thousands of her compatriots were killed by a regime seemingly intent on not only rewriting the past, but on destroying all who remembered it. Mam's story, told to Criddle (who sponsored the family's emigration to the United States), reveals with simple sensitivity and insight another perspective of the nightmare brought to light in the film The Killing Fields. A moving, difficult, important book. Highly recommended. Kenneth W. Berger, Duke Univ.

Her collaborations with Andre Norton on the novels Beast Master&#x2019;s Ark and Beast Master&#x2019;s Circus , were both awarded the Sir Julius Vogel Award for Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Novel by a New Zealander. Their third Beast Master collaboration, Beast Master&#x2019;s Quest was recently published. She has also collaborated with Miss Norton on the Witch World novel The Duke&#x2019;s Ballad . She lives in Norsewood, New Zealand.Norton adds a new name to her respectable roster of collaborators, another volume to the Witch World canon, and, not incidentally, another highly readable book to her massive body of work. The plot is classic--a young girl of Native American and Celtic ancestry and possessing knowledge of both traditions' magical lore passes into the Witch World. Once there, she discovers that she needs to learn its ways and how to use her magic. As she does both, she survives intrigues and battles and finds love, or at least a congenial prospect for life companionship. Norton and McConchie mesh smoothly, and thanks to the plot, their book is a better introduction to the Witch World than some other recent works about Norton's most enduring creation. Consider this a necessary addition to the Norton shelf. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Principles of Christian Morality</h2><p>A collection of essays by three giants of twentieth-cenutry theology: Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI), Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Heinz Schurmann.

But there is another, hidden history of that war that has too often been ignored in official accounts. <br><br>Boris Gorbachevsky was a junior officer in the 31st Army who first saw front-line duty as a rifleman in the 30th Army. Through the Maelstrom recounts his three harrowing years on some of the war's grimmest but forgotten battlefields: the campaign for Rzhev, the bloody struggle to retake Belorussia, and the bitter final fighting in East Prussia. As he traces his experiences from his initial training, through the maelstrom, to final victory, he provides one of the richest and most detailed memoirs of life and warfare on the Eastern Front. <br><br>Gorbachevsky's panoramic account takes us from infantry specialist school to the front lines to rear services areas and his whirlwind romances in wartime Moscow. He recalls the shriek of Katiusha rockets flying overhead toward the enemy and the unforgettable howl of Stukas divebombing Soviet tanks. And he conveys horrors of brutal fighting not recorded previously in English, including his own participation in a human wave assault that decimated his regiment at Rzhev, with piles of corpses growing the closer they got to the German trenches. <br><br>Gorbachevsky also records the sufferings of the starving citizens of Leningrad, the savage execution of a Russian scout who turned in false information, the killing of an innocent German trying to welcome the Soviet troops, and a chilling campfire discussion by four Russian soldiers as they compared notes about the women they'd raped. His memoir brims with rich descriptions of daily army life, the challenges of maintaining morale, and relationships between soldiers. It also includes candid exposs of the many problems the Red Army faced: the influence of political officers, the stubbornness of senior commanders, the attrition through desertions, and the initial months of occupation in postwar Germany. <br><br><i>Through the Maelstrom</i> features the swiftly moving narrative and rich dialogue associated with the grand style of great Russian literature. Ultimately, it provides a fitting and final testament to soldiers who fought and died in anonymity.</p><p>"This extraordinary memoir represents a veritable final testament to the countless millions of Soviet soldiers who fought and often perished in cruel anonymity. Gorbachevsky describes the tactical fighting in which he took part and the personalities and command styles of his superior commanders, all with a tailor's keen eye for preserving detail and refreshing candor regarding the real conditions that Red Army soldiers endured. . . .

Narrator William Dufris&#39;s skilled delivery of the fantasy of reliving one&#39;s life has just the right tone of wise hindsight. Dufris astutely conveys Winston&#39;s complex emotions as he comes to realize that knowledge of the future is at once a blessing and a curse. With a layered tone, Dufris molds a character who understands what he must do to correct his past mistakes, but who seems doomed to fail no matter what action he takes. Through it all, Dufris injects a subtle questioning into Winston&#39;s voice as he ponders--&#34;Why me?&#34; L.B. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Dogs Don&#39;t Brush Their Teeth!</h2><p>Laugh out-loud dog fun!<br><br>Readers of all ages will howl out loud as thirty five different dogs show what they can do, and what they can't do!

Her letters, as Jessamyn West said of the earlier volume, "are, in fact (though not that alone), a collection of short stories." She added that "what makes these letters so good are not these stories, but the character of the storyteller, of Elinore Stewart herself. Her letters endure and give pleasure because she does what the great letter-writers do: she reveals herself. . . . It is the woman in this vanished landscape, the homesteader with her enormous vitality, humor, and tenderness who holds our attention." Jessamyn West's wish to know more about the author herself is fulfilled in the foreword to Letters on an Elk Hunt&#x2014;an appreciative biographical sketch, incorporating material from some of Mrs. Stewart's unpublished letters as well as the reminiscences of her children.<p>Elizabeth Fuller Ferris, of the Wilderness Women Project, Missoula, Montana, is the writer and producer of Burntfork, a film for public television funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities based upon the life of Elinore Pruitt Stewart.</p></p><p>Elinore Pruitt Stewart was born in 1878.

As the schisms in her family unfold, we draw closer to an unexpected climax that holds breathtaking surprises and its own hard-won redemption. In Eva, Shriver has created a narrator who is touching, sad, funny, and reflective. A spellbinding read, <i>We Need to Talk About Kevin</i> is as original as it is timely.</p></p><p><p>Eva never really wanted to be a mother&#x2014;and certainly not the mother of a boy who ends up murdering seven of his fellow high school students, a cafeteria worker, and a much-adored teacher who tried to befriend him, all two days before his sixteenth birthday. Now, two years later, it is time for her to come to terms with marriage, career, family, parenthood, and Kevin&#x2019;s horrific rampage, in a series of startlingly direct correspondences with her estranged husband, Franklin. Uneasy with the sacrifices and social demotion of motherhood from the start, Eva fears that her alarming dislike for her own son may be responsible for driving him so nihilistically off the rails.</p>Lionel Shriver is the author of seven novels, and has written extensively for the Guardian, Wall Street Journal, the Philadelphia Inquirer, and The Economist.

But knitters and sewers will welcome this extremely detailed, comprehensive, and creative look at personalizing thread-based projects. The authors take painstaking care to ensure that the 26 alphabets, a few sets of numbers, and pages of dingbats-plus (think punctuation marks and symbols used for emoticons) are not only charted; at least a handful are also produced on swatches, with a paragraph or so explaining techniques and possible hiccups, especially for novices. Though the actual alphabet patterns are more than a bit quirky&#x2014;after all, how can you label five different decades as retro?&#x2014;the swatches and 10 projects will boost use. It&#x2019;s hard to resist a pristinely white baby blanket with a name and birth date, or a pair of wrist cuffs emblazoned with emoticons. At the end, the authors explain and illustrate more elaborate techniques, from beading to stranding, and conclude with a list of abbreviations and yarns.

Is it the shops, the buildings, the roads, the schools? Or is it the people? Answering this question is easy for effervescent young Quinito, who knows most of his neighbors&#x2013;in fact, he is related to many of them. From his carpenter mother and nurse father to his aunt the muralist and cousin Tita, a clown, his is a network of love that encompasses teachers, crossing guards, bankers, postal workers, dance instructors, and truck drivers.

They were first laid out in 1694 by Guillaume Beaumont, who also worked at Hampton Court Palace. The gardens have changed little since. In addition to the famous topiary, the gardens display stunning seasonal bedding, a &#34;wilderness&#34;, an orchard and vegetable and herb gardens in a series of small compartments, making them a useful source of inspiration for visitors. There is a wealth of contrasting features, and an impressive collection of plant varieties, not to mention the earliest ha-ha, or sunken ditch, in England. The gardens at Levens Hall resonate with their 300-year-old heritage while incorporating new developments and changing influences. Head gardener Chris Crowder narrates the rich history of the gardens and presents a detailed horticultural description of them today and the work that goes on there. The text is illustrated with new photography by Vivian Russell as well as illustrations from the Levens archives.</p><p>Chris Crowder has been the head gardener at Levens since 1986. Vivian Russell is a writer and photographer. An American by birth, she has lived in England and France for most of her life. Her book Monet&#39;s Garden won two Garden Writers&#39; Guild Awards. She was a regular contributor to both Gardens Illustrated and the Daily Telegraph gardening supplement for many years.... affectionate, informative history, half of which is devoted to the garden today, draws on a wealth of surviving primary-source material, allowing the voices of bygone gardeners to speak as the garden itself continues to do House &amp; Garden ... a splendidly unpretentious and beautifully crafted book...

In <em>Antiquity</em>, Cantor covers such subjects as Classical Greece, Judaism, the founding of Christianity, and the triumph and decline of Rome.</p><p>In this fascinating and comprehensive analysis, the author explores social and cultural history, as well as the political and economic aspects of his narrative. He explains leading themes in religion and philosophy and discusses the environment, population, and public health. With his signature authority and insight, Cantor highlights the great books and ideas of antiquity that continue to influence culture today.</p></p><p><p>Norman F. Cantor was Emeritus Professor of History, Sociology, and Comparative Literature at New York University. His many books include <em>In the Wake of the Plague</em>, <em>Inventing the Middle Ages</em>, and <em>The Civilization of the Middle Ages</em>, the most widely read narrative of the Middle Ages in the English language. He died in 2004.</p>An NYU emeritus professor of history, sociology and comparative literature, Cantor does for antiquity what he did for medieval times in his acclaimed The Civilization of the Middle Ages. With his characteristic eloquence and lucid insights, he offers a majestic introductory survey of the major empires of the ancient world, divided into two parts. The first provides a basic narrative of Hellenistic culture, the Roman Empire and Christianity. In clear prose, Cantor outlines the development of each of those cultures without many details about the evolution of each society. In the second part, he offers a more detailed exploration of the development of each of these ancient cultures, as well as ancient Judaism and Egypt. For example, in his chapter on Rome, Cantor discusses in detail the rise of jurisprudence and the Roman emphasis on civil society that can be traced to Cicero and Caesar. Cantor offers some wonderfully rich characterizations of ancient Greek philosophers: Socrates was a "hippie stonecutter who expounded on philosophy in the Athenian marketplace, perhaps to avoid going home to face his shrewish wife"; Plato was "part of a fast crowd of rich young men"; his Academy was the first talk show. Although Cantor makes a few missteps-the Gnostics are not also called the Manichees, though the latter might have practiced Gnosticism-Cantor offers a splendid and accessible portrait of the cultures of the ancient world.

In <i>The Master</i>, his fictionalized life of Henry James, To�b�n made the reader see and understand the writer more fully than ever before. Similarly, these new stories look at relationships between fully formed adults and, with a few deft strokes, make clear what their mutual history has brought them to. In most cases, they must deal with loss, while trying to grasp the complexities of that sometimes precarious balance between a mother and her son. <p> In the first story, "The Use of Reason," a lifelong burglar is nearly brought down by his mother, who talks too much when she drinks in her local pub. In "A Song," Noel, on the town with a group of his musician friends, ends up in the same bar as his estranged mother, who is asked to sing. She sings an Irish ballad about love and treachery and he is convinced that she is singing directly to him. In "A Priest in the Family," Molly's son Frank is accused of abuse, but no one has the courage to tell her until it is almost time for the trial. Her reaction is not entirely predictable. "Three Friends" takes place after a young man attends his mother's funeral. He joins his friends for a night of carousing and drugs ending with a late-night swim, where he is emboldened to make an overt sexual pass at one of his buddies, with interesting results. The final story, "A Long Winter," is set in Spain in a remote village. Miquel's mother drinks. Everyone knows it but Miquel. His father pours out her supply of booze and she leaves the house. So far it's a simple story. It doesn't stay that way. Each of these stories has its own gravitas, its own sadness, and that laser-beam of insight that is To�b�n's trademark. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><b>Colm T�ib�n</b> was born in Ireland in 1955.

This kid pleasing, sing-along song is now a hilarious book.<br><br>In this irresistible book it's not just field mice that suffer Little Bunny Foo Foo's mischievous tricks, but woodchucks, foxes, &amp; grizzly bears! And as LBFF's subjects grow so do his scooping methods, from lasso to tractor bucket to crane. All the while, LBFF takes his naughtiness to hyperbolic heights as the Good Fairy--hilariously rendered as a possum--points out the error of his wayward ways w/ humor &amp; spunk. Painted in a warm, folksy style w/ vibrant colors &amp; soft edges, Johnson strikes just the right balance between the joys of being bad &amp; a tongue-in-cheek lesson in behavioral reform.</p><p>Publishers Weekly<br>(February 2, 2004; 0-439-37301-8)<br><br>In this escalating tale of misbehavior, based on a children's song, Little Bunny Foo Foo pelts woodland animals with "yucky-mucky mud pies." He rides a red wagon and mini-motorcycle in pursuit of smaller creatures, then upgrades to a tractor and crane to chase bigger game. A rhythmic refrain names his victims: "Little Bunny Foo Foo/ Hoppin' through the forest/ Scoopin' up the field mice/ And boppin' 'em on the head." The delinquent's gleeful antics are observed by a pointy-nosed, outraged opossum in a gaudy purple-and- yellow tutu. This foolish-looking "good fairy" wags her finger and scolds, "Little Bunny Foo Foo/ I don't wanna see you/ Scoopin' up the field mice/ And boppin' 'em on the head." She gives him three chances, "or I'll turn you into a goon!" (The threat leaves readers understandably curious for the outcome.) Unbowed, the bratty rabbit attacks woodchucks, foxes and bears, forcing the fairy to wave her wand and leave him dressed as a circus clown. Johnson (The Cow Who Wouldn't Come Down), who favors rustic tricksters in the Br'er Rabbit mold, styles the impish title character as a rubbery-limbed joker while asserting that the animals get "bop[ped] on the head" with nothing worse than drippy brown mud. The opossum's wrath provides an effective buildup, but the culminating one-liner ("Hare today, goon tomorrow") ends on a humdrum note, with the mud-spattered crowd laughing on a variegated green hillside. Ages 2-5. (Feb.) Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information.<br><br>Booklist<br>(January 1, 2004; 0-439-37301-8)<br><br>PreS-Gr. 1. In this picture-book interpretation of a classic ditty, Little Bunny Foo Foo's transgressions are narrated by the Good Fairy herself, who is at cross-purposes with Foo Foo in the matter of boppin' field mice and other woodland critters. Yucky, mucky mud pies are Foo Foo's weapons of choice, and, in a twist that will be welcome by fans of things that go vroom, the rabbit chases down victims in increasingly outrageous vehicles.ohnson paints in a pleasant, color-flecked style, although his Good Fairy, a bizarre amalgam of a woman and an opossum, will probably baffle children whose mental image is based on Tinkerbell. But the interactive spirit of the song is intact, thanks to type that changes color at moments appropriate for group participation, and the visual presentation is silly enough to match the fun of saying foo foo and goon at the top of one's lungs. Music, complete lyrics, and descriptions of the hand moves are included. --Jennifer Mattson Copyright 2004 Booklist<br><br>PreSchool-Grade 4-Johnson adds humor and wit to this storytime favorite. The Good Fairy, who is credited on the front cover as a cocreator, narrates the story of naughty Little Bunny Foo Foo, who scoops up field mice, woodchucks, foxes, and bears and bops them on the head. In this version, the rabbit hits them with mud pies. The Good Fairy, an opossum in a tiara, a purple-and-yellow dress, and purple pumps, gives the rabbit three chances to be good, but when he persists, she keeps her promise and turns him into a goon. He now looks like a clownish caricature of himself, complete with red fuzzy hair and baggy pants. The text is folksy and the familiar lyrics are printed in purple. The lively illustrations convey action and hilarity: the mischievous bunny chases after the unsuspecting animals in various modes of transportation ranging from a red wagon to a full-size crane. Covered with mud, the animals angrily shake their paws at the rabbit, who feigns remorse, and they chuckle and dance with glee when he turns into the silly goon. Music, lyrics, and suggestions for movements are included. A twist on a traditional song, this book is sure to tickle the funny bones of young listeners and their adult friends.<i>-Shawn Brommer, South Central Library System, Madison, WI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Young Petrello and Tolomeo must fight to protect their siblings and their kingdom as an evil force invades the once-peaceful Red Castle. Readers will embark on one last adventure in the thrilling finale to Jenny Nimmo's extraordinary Chronicles of the Red King trilogy.</p><p>Jenny Nimmo is the author of the NEW YORK TIMES and USA TODAY bestselling Charlie Bone series as well as GRIFFIN'S CASTLE, THE DRAGON'S CHILD, and the award-winning Magician Trilogy, all published by Orchard Books. Several of her books have been awarded and shortlisted for the Smarties Prize, the Carnegie Medal, the Whitbread Award, and the WH Smith Mind-Boggling Books Award. She lives with her husband in an old mill in Wales.<br><br>Gr 3&#x2013;7&#x2014;King Timoken, the Red King of Africa, lives in the world of men and the world of magic. He now resides in an enchanted castle with his uniquely talented Castilian-born wife, Berenice, and their nine children. Within the walls of the Red Castle live Timoken's sister, a wizard, three magical and protective leopards, among others; the castle can become invisible in order to remain hidden. Timoken's children are just beginning to realize their special talents; some are used for good, others for evil. Soon a plot is uncovered that threatens the safety of the king and his kith and kin, and uncovers familial betrayal. When Timoken is held captive by malevolent forces, his sons, 10-year-old Petrollo and nine-year-old Tolomen, combine their exceptional and powerful talents to save their father and the kingdom. This title (Scholastic, 2013) can stand alone in spite of references to earlier tales. John Keating's expressive, well-paced narration breathes life into the characters and allows listeners to distinguish among them. Though the story begins rather slowly, it ultimately becomes action-packed and fast moving to a satisfying if convenient conclusion. This is likely to appeal to fans of the author's "Charlie Bone" series-the "Chronicles of the Red King" is that series' prequel-or of Keating's other readings.&#x2014;Maria Salvadore, formerly of the Washington, DC Public Library</p><h2>The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence</h2><p>Fifty years ago, as Europe's colonial powers withdrew, Africa moved with enormous hope and fervor toward democracy and economic independence. Dozens of new states were launched amid much jubilation and the world's applause. African leaders, popularly elected, stepped forward to tackle the problems of development and nation-building. In the Cold War era, the new states excited the attention of the superpowers. Africa was considered too valuable a prize to lose.<p> Today, Africa is a continent rife with disease, death, and devastation. Most African countries are effectively bankrupt, prone to civil strife, subject to dictatorial rule, and dependent on Western assistance for survival. The sum of Africa's misfortunes &#x2014; its wars, its despotisms, its corruption, its droughts &#x2014; is truly daunting.</p><p> What went wrong? What happened to this vast continent, so rich in resources, culture and history, to bring it so close to destitution and despair in the space of two generations?</p><p> Focusing on the key personalities, events and themes of the independence era, Martin Meredith's riveting narrative history seeks to explore and explain the myriad problems that Africa has faced in the past half-century, and faces still. From the giddy enthusiasm of the 1960s to the "coming of tyrants" and rapid decline, <b>The Fate of Africa</b> is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand how it came to this &#x2014; and what, if anything, is to be done.</p></p><p><b>Martin Meredith</b> is a journalist, biographer and historian who has written extensively on Africa. His previous books include <i>In the Name of Apartheid; Nelson Mandela; Our Votes, Our Guns: Robert Mugabe and the Tragedy of Zimbabwe;</i> and <i>Elephant Destiny</i>. He lives near Oxford, England.<i>Starred Review.</i> The value of Meredith's towering history of modern Africa rests not so much in its incisive analysis, or its original insights; it is the sheer readability of the project, combined with a notable lack of pedantry, that makes it one of the decade's most important works on Africa. Spanning the entire continent, and covering the major upheavals more or less chronologically&#x2014;from the promising era of independence to the most recent spate of infamies (Rwanda, Darfur, Zimbabwe, Liberia, Sierra Leone)&#x2014;Meredith (<i>In the Name of Apartheid</i>) brings us on a journey that is as illuminating as it is grueling. The best chapters, not surprisingly, deal with the countries that Meredith knows intimately: South Africa and Zimbabwe; he is less convincing when discussing the francophone West African states. Nowhere is Meredith more effective than when he gives free rein to his biographer's instincts, carefully building up the heroic foundations of national monuments like Nasser, Nkrumah, and Haile Selassie&#x2014;only to thoroughly demolish those selfsame mythical edifices in later chapters. In an early chapter dealing with Biafra and the Nigerian civil war, Meredith paints a truly horrifying picture, where opportunities are invariably squandered, and ethnically motivated killings and predatory opportunism combine to create an infernal downward spiral of suffering and mayhem (which Western intervention only serves to aggravate). His point is simply that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely&#x2014;which is why the rare exceptions to that rule (Senghor and Mandela chief among them) are all the more remarkable. Whether or not his pessimism about the continent's future is fully warranted, Meredith's history provides a gripping digest of the endemic woes confronting the cradle of humanity. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Today there are the obvious ironies - sprawl, spaghetti junctions and skid row-but the place is not so easily distilled or visualized, either as a clich�d paradise or as its demise. There&#39;s a strange kind of harmony when it&#39;s all seen together-the sublime, the psychedelic, the self-destructive. Like all places, it&#39;s unpredictable and contradictory, but to greater extremes. Cultures and histories coexist, the beautiful sits next to the ugly, the redemptive next to the despairing, and all under a strange and singular light, as transcendent as it is harsh. The pictures in this book begin in the desert east of Los Angeles and move west through the city, ending at the Pacific. This general westward movement alludes to a thirst for water, as well as the original expansion of America, which was born in the East and which hungrily drove itself West until reaching the Pacific, thereby fulfilling its &#34;manifest&#34; destiny. The people, places, and animals in the book did exist before Halpern&#39;s camera, but he has sewn these photographs into a work of fiction or fantasy-a structure, sequence and edit which, like Los Angeles itself, teeters on the brink of collapsing under the weight of its own strangely-shaped mass.</p><p></p><h2>PT 109: An American Epic of War, Survival, and the Destiny of John F.

Commander William Liebenow, the man who rescued JFK and the PT 109 crew in August 1943.</strong></p><p>In the early morning darkness of August 2, 1943, during a chaotic nighttime skirmish amid the Solomon Islands, the Japanese destroyer&nbsp;<em>Amagiri</em>&nbsp;barreled through thick fog and struck the U.S. Navy's motor torpedo boat PT 109, splitting the craft nearly in half and killing two American sailors instantly. The sea erupted in flames as the 109's skipper, John F. Kennedy, and the ten surviving crewmen under his command desperately clung to the sinking wreckage; 1,200 feet of ink-black, shark-infested water loomed beneath. "All hands lost," came the reports back to the Americans' base: no rescue was coming for the men of PT 109. Their desperate ordeal was just beginning&#x2014;so too was one of the most remarkable tales of World War II, one whose astonishing afterlife would culminate two decades later in the White House.</p><p>Drawing on original interviews with the last living links to the events, previously untapped Japanese wartime archives, and a wealth of archival documents from the Kennedy Library, including a lost first-hand account by JFK himself, bestselling author William Doyle has crafted a thrilling and definitive account of the sinking of PT 109 and its shipwrecked crew's heroics. Equally fascinating is the story's second act, in which Doyle explores in new detail how this extraordinary episode shaped Kennedy's character and fate, proving instrumental to achieving his presidential ambitions: "Without PT 109, there never would have been a President John F.

Using the Bard&#x2019;s own immortal list of a man&#x2019;s seven ages in <i>As You Like It</i>, Bate deduces the crucial events of Shakespeare&#x2019;s life and connects them to his world and work as never before.<br><br>Here is the author as an infant, born into a world of plague and syphillis, diseases with which he became closely familiar; as a schoolboy, a position he portrayed in <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, in which a clever, cheeky lad named William learns Latin grammar; as a lover, married at eighteen to an older woman already pregnant, perhaps presaging Bassanio, who in <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>won a wife who could save him from financial ruin. Here, too, is Shakespeare as a soldier, writing Henry the Fifth&#x2019;s St. Crispin&#x2019;s Day speech, with a nod to his own monarch Elizabeth I&#x2019;s passionate addresses; as a justice, revealing his possible legal training in his precise use of the law in plays from <i>Hamlet</i> to <i>Macbeth</i>; and as a pantaloon, an early retiree because of, Bate postulates, either illness or a scandal. Finally, Shakespeare enters oblivion, with sonnets that suggest he actively sought immortality through his art and secretly helped shape his posthumous image more than anyone ever knew.<br><br>Equal parts masterly detective story, brilliant literary analysis, and insightful world history, <b>Soul of the Age</b> is more than a superb new recounting of Shakespeare&#x2019;s experiences; it is a bold and entertaining work of scholarship and speculation, one that shifts from past to present, reality to the imagination, to reveal how this unsurpassed artist came to be.</p><p>Jonathan Bate is a professor of Shakespeare and Renaissance literature at the University of Warwick.

But Shakespeare&#x2019;s Winter&#x2019;s Tale veers from tragedy to comedy. Young Shepherd&#x2019;s breathless description of heavy matters is counterpointed against Old Shepherd&#x2019;s amazed discovery of new life in the form of the abandoned baby Perdita. &#x201c;Thou met&#x2019;st with things dying,&#x201d; he serenely remarks to his son, &#x201c;I with things new born.&#x201d;<br><br>In Shakespeare&#x2019;s England, birth and death went cheek by jowl. Each entry in the parish register of Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon- Avon, is encoded with a single letter: C for christened, M for married, and B for buried. A ceaseless procession of birth, copulation, and death: human life stripped to its essentials. Shortly after the entry that reads &#x201c;1564, Apr. 26. C. Gulielmus filius Johannes Shakspere&#x201d;&#x2014;April 26, 1564, christened, William, son of John Shakespeare&#x2014;the entries marked B begin to thicken on the page. There were no more than twenty deaths in the first half of 1564, well over two hundred in the second. The population of this small but prosperous market town in the English Midland county of Warwickshire was about fifteen hundred, so more than one in seven were taken in those few months of devastation. The cause is duly noted in a marginal annotation opposite the burial entry for Oliver Gunne, apprentice: hic incepit pestis. Here begins the plague.<br><br>In August, the town council met in emergency session in the garden of the Gild Chapel, hoping that the outdoor air would be less contagious than that of the Gild Hall. They discussed relief for the plague victims. &#x201c;Burgess&#x201d; (councillor) John Shakespeare gave a generous sum of money. The horror faced by the townspeople may be glimpsed from a contemporary account of a plague outbreak in London. If just one member of a family was struck down, the rest would have been closed up in the house to prevent the spread of infection:<br><br>What an unmatchable torment were it for a man to be barred up every night in a vast silent charnel-house? Hung (to make it more hideous) with lamps dimly and slowly burning, in hollow and glimmering corners: where all the pavement should, instead of green rushes, be strewed with blasted rosemary, withered hyacinths, fatal cypress and yew, thickly mingled with heaps of dead men&#x2019;s bones: the bare ribs of a father that begat him, lying there: here the chapless hollow skull of a mother that bore him.<br><br>The previous year, John and Mary Shakespeare had lost their infant Margaret at four months, and sometime before that, another girl, Joan. Cause of deaths unknown. But the loss not uncommon&#x2014;everyone knew infant mortality.<br><br>They were doubly lucky this time. William was what every respectable couple wanted: a son to maintain the family name and estate. His sex was their first stroke of good fortune. Second was his survival of the plague. What John and Mary could never know was that he would not merely survive, but make the Shakespeare name live as long as humankind has books and stories.<br><br>Plague was the single most powerful force shaping his life and those of his contemporaries. John Stow&#x2019;s annals of English history summarized the key events of the year of Shakespeare&#x2019;s birth. The previous autumn, Londoners had suffered terribly: &#x201c;Forsomuch as the plague of pestilence was so hot in the city of London, there was no term kept at Michaelmas: to be short, the poor citizens of London were this year plagued with a threefold plague, pestilence, scarcity of money, and dearth of victuals: the misery whereof, were too long here to write, no doubt the poor remember it, the rich by flight into the countries made shift for themselves.&#x201d;<br><br>John Stow, denominated &#x201c;Citizen of London&#x201d; on his title page, would not have bothered to record an outbreak of plague in a small town in the Midlands. There is London and there is the rest of England. London is far bigger than every other conurbation. It is more densely populated, so the spread of plague is more rapid. And it is the location of the institutions that govern the nation: the royal court, the houses of Parliament and the law courts, Lambeth Palace (London residence of the archbishop of Canterbury and administrative headquarters of the Church of England). In bad times, the rich and their institutions could take flight to the country, leaving the London poor to shift for themselves. The royal court was supremely mobile, with the queen moving on a whim or a plague warning from Whitehall in central London to one of her other palaces&#x2014;Greenwich downstream, Hampton Court upstream, Richmond or Windsor secluded in their deer parks, or Nonsuch deep in rural Surrey.<br><br>It was a litigious age. Stow measures the seasons by the four terms of the legal year, when the courts were in session. During times of plague, as in Michaelmas term (October to December) 1563 and Hilary term (January to March) 1564, the judges and lawyers met out of town. Throughout Shakespeare&#x2019;s professional career, there were close links between the worlds of law and theater. Many of his fellow dramatists trained at the Inns of Court. Law students were a key element of the theater audience. Hack writer Tom Nashe railed against the &#x201c;tedious dead vacation&#x201d; when there were no lawyers to see his plays or buy his pamphlets. And, like the law courts, the acting companies traveled out of town when plague was severe.<br><br>So it was that plague determined several turning points in Shakespeare&#x2019;s career. In January 1593, just as he was making his name as an actor turned playwright, an order went out from the Privy Council: &#x201c;Forasmuch as by the certificate of the last week it appeareth the infection doth increase . . . we think it fit that all manner of concourse and public meetings of the people at plays, bear- baitings, bowlings and other like assemblies for sports be forbidden.&#x201d; Save for a few weeks&#x2019; remission the following winter, the theaters remained closed for a year and a half. The actors toured, while a different Shakespeare emerged. The rewrite man, the patcher of old plays from the existing repertoire, turned himself into an original poet. In April 1593, he published &#x201c;the first heir&#x201d; of his &#x201c;invention,&#x201d; Venus and Adonis. Its stylistic brilliance and risqu� content made his name among the smart set. It became the bestselling long poem of the age, the favored reading of undergraduates and Inns of Court men. Dedicated to Henry Wriothesley, the third earl of Southampton, it was also a bid for patronage.<br><br>The dedicatory epistle that begins the more serious and rhetorically elaborate follow-up poem, The Rape of Lucrece, published the next year, suggests that the bid was successful. Where Shakespeare&#x2019;s letter prefacing Venus and Adonis dwells on his &#x201c;hopeful expectation,&#x201d; the one attached to Lucrece speaks repeatedly of &#x201c;duty&#x201d; and devoted service: &#x201c;What I have done is yours, what I have to do is yours, being part in all I have, devoted yours.&#x201d; There is a strong possibility that Shakespeare spent part of the plague year in some form of service in Southampton&#x2019;s household at Titchfield in Hampshire.<br><br>The association with Southampton had three key consequences. It transformed Shakespeare from jobbing playwright to courtly poet, marked him out as the crossover man who could appeal equally to penny- paying groundlings and powerful courtiers or even the queen herself. Politically, it brought him into the orbit of the earl of Essex, to whom young Southampton was devoted. This would have potentially dangerous consequences a few years later. And intellectually, it introduced him to the work of the Anglo-Italian man of letters John Florio, Southampton&#x2019;s tutor, through whom he was exposed to Italian culture and, later, the essays of Michel de Montaigne, whose subtle, sympathetic mind was perfectly attuned to his own.<br><br>The plague of 1593&#x2013;94 provided an enforced sabbatical after which Shakespeare returned to the theater with a new-minted verbal art. In the next couple of years, he wrote the plays in which his literary style truly matures: the dazzlingly intellectual (Florioesque) Love&#x2019;s Labour&#x2019;s Lost, the miraculously imaginative Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream, and the quicksilver Romeo and Juliet, with its growth from love&#x2019;s artifice to the heart&#x2019;s authenticity. When Mercutio dies with the words &#x201c;A plague o&#x2019; both your houses,&#x201d; it is no idle oath: the play was written in the aftermath of a period when the households of many members of Shakespeare&#x2019;s London audience would have been struck by plague. And plague is indeed subtly woven into the plot: the reason Romeo does not get Friar Laurence&#x2019;s crucial letter is that Friar John is detained for fear that he might have been infected. Parents are supposed to die before their children, the old before the young. With plague, it is not always like that. The tragic irony of Romeo and Juliet is that the houses of both Capulet and Montague escape the plague, yet still the children die first. The final scene takes place in an ancestral tomb, but those who lie dead are the flower of a city&#x2019;s youth&#x2014;Mercutio, Tybalt, Paris, Juliet, and her Romeo.<br><br>Plague also shapes the deep structure of Shakespeare&#x2019;s imaginative world. As Queen Elizabeth secluded herself from infection at Richmond and Nonsuch, so Ferdinand King of Navarre and his courtiers in Love&#x2019;s Labour&#x2019;s Lost enclose themselves in a garden world. As A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream counterpoints city and court (Athens) against green world and fairy lore (the wood), so S...</p><h2>The Fairy Godmother (Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms, Book 1)</h2><p>The Fairy Godmother by Mercedes Lackey released on Dec 25, 2003 is available now for purchase.</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Mercedes Lackey has written over one hundred titles and has no plans to slow down.&nbsp;Known best for her tales of Valdemar and The Five Hundred Kingdoms, she's also a prolific lyricist and records her own music.The prolific Lackey (the Valdemar series) draws on the darker, Brothers Grimm side of fairy lore for her enchanting tale, the first title under a new Harlequin imprint to spotlight romantic fantasy. In the land of the Five Hundred Kingdoms, the Tradition, that ineffable magic, holds the promise of happily-ever-after for all deserving young maidens and courteous princes charming. But the Tradition also leads some in its thrall to pain, suffering and gruesome death. Feisty 19-year-old Elena Klovis seems destined to be an Ella of the Cinders (Cinderella), at the mercy of her wicked stepmother and greedy stepsisters. To escape their clutches, Elena tries to get work as a maidservant, but her fairy godmother, Madame Bella, has other plans for her. Elena becomes Madame Bella's apprentice, doing her best, among other challenges, to ensure that evil does not subvert Tradition. The only problem is that fairy godmothers are not themselves allowed to fall in love. It's up to Elena, who has vowed to reform a wayward prince, to tease out the threads of a new Tradition. Lackey has created an intelligent, self-possessed heroine with whom many readers will identify. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author repeats his technique of surveying all aspects of the history of the year--social, political, financial--on a worldwide basis, but with the focus in this case on the United States. He works his way through the year, telling the tales of major figures, from Hoover to Baruch, and minor, such as small investor Edgar D. Brown. Gordon Thomas and Max M. Witts's The Day the Bubble Burst ( LJ 11/1/79) covered similar ground, but Klingaman's book was written in light of the 1987 crash, and the circumstances it relates speak directly to the question, "Could it happen again?" Highly recommended.<br><i>- Pat Ensor, Indiana State Univ. Lib., Terre Haute</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.The year 1929 saw both the peak of roaring-'20s prosperity and the stock market collapse that led to the Great Depression, when a third of the U.S. work force was unemployed. With vivid narrative and anecdotal profiles of such diverse characters as Herbert Hoover, Al Capone, Joseph P. Kennedy, the Marx Brothers, F. Scott Fitzgerald and J. P. Morgan, Klingaman ( 1919 ; 1941 ) shows that the same "mob psychology" that "had borne the bull market to irrational heights" eventually dragged stock prices far below inherent value. RCA, for example, plunged from 110 to 26. Ostentatious wealth, Prohibition gang wars, deadly labor suppression, political corruption, bank and brokerage wipeouts and margin-loan suicides: all are seen here as part of an economic and government failure that preceded the rise of Adolf Hitler and Franklin D. Roosevelt. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>J and J Language Readers: Level 1, Books A-C</h2><p>Readers to accompany Language : a literacy intervention curriculum by Jane Fell Green.

Dispatched to Vienna as the Cold War began to rage, Kisevalter ran the first key Soviet agent in CIA history, Pyotr Popov, and gained the U.S. its first view behind the Iron Curtain. More impressive was his next agent, Soviet colonel Oleg Penkovsky, regarded as the most successful spy in CIA history. Penkovsky supplied the West with more than ten thousand pages of unsurpassed intelligence. This top-secret information proved decisive for Kennedy during the showdown of the Cuban missile crisis. More than a biography, CIA SpyMaster is a glimpse into the mind of an espionage genius, a rare view of what it takes to "live in the black" for years at a time under a fictitious identity, torn from friends and family. It's a behind-the-scenes look at spycraft in action, from dead drops and cutoffs to multilayered ciphers, the KGB's secret "spydust," and everything in between. It is a book of ever-increasing tension and suspense, as the rising stakes of the Cold War endow every act of espionage with utmost importance. During his lifetime, George Kisevalter was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the highest award attainable in the CIA without giving one's life. For his work with Penkovsky, he received a Certificate of Merit with Distinction. Less than two months before his death in 1997, he was selected as one of fifty "unique contributors" in the fifty-year history of the CIA and was presented with the newly established Trailblazers Award, the only case officer ever to be so honored.</p></p><h2>Plants of the Western Boreal Forest and Aspen Parkland: including Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba</h2><p>Over 620 species of trees, shrubs, wildflowers, grasses, ferns, mosses and lichens are illustrated and described, covering the northern forest from Alaska to Minnesota.</p><p>LINDA KERSHAW is the best-selling author of a number of nature books published by Lone Pine.

Carrying sticks in their mouths? Begging for food? Who could be responsible for such silly shenanigans except everybody's favorite baby-sitter, Carl, who takes a group of neighborhood children on a lively game of Follow the Leader. Readers will want to follow Carl's exploits through town and country again and again, and Alexandra Day's lush autumnal landscapes are the perfect setting for the funny goings-on in the game.</p></p><p><p><b>Alexandra Day</b> is the pseudonym for Sandra Louise Woodward Darling. She is the author of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i> and the rest of the beloved Carl books, including <i>Carl Goes Shopping</i>, <i>Carl's Christmas</i>, <i>Carl's Birthday</i> and <i>Carl's Snowy Afternoon</i>. Darling was born in 1941 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to a large and close-knit family. Painting was a popular family recreation, and almost every family excursion included one or more easels and a variety of sketch pads, chalks, paints, and pencils. For four years, the family lived on a hundred-acre farm in Kentucky. Here young Sandra grew especially fond of riding and training horses, and became a dog owner for the first time. Living in the country also provided plenty of time for reading, a life-long passion. </p><p>Sandra illustrated her first book in 1983: <i>The Teddy Bears' Picnic</i>, a popular children's song by Jimmy Kennedy. That same year, she was visiting Zurich, Switzerland, when she came across a volume of old German picture sheets, one of which featured a poodle playing with a baby who was supposed to be taking a nap. This image proved the inspiration for <i>Good Dog, Carl</i>. The Darlings' own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the model for the book's main character. Since then, two other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the seven sequels: the late Arambarri, who was named for one of the Darlings' favorite jai alai players; and Zabala, who currently moonlights as an Our Best Friend therapy dog, visiting hospitals to cheer patients. </p><p>About her work Sandra says: "I think that one of the reasons my illustrations have appealed to people is that they can sense my sincerity. I know that marvels exist which are just outside our ordinary experience, but that at any moment we may turn a corner and encounter one of them. Children also believe this, and because they and I have this conviction in common, we, as creator and audience, make good partners." Sandra lives in Seattle, Washington, with her husband, Harold.</p>Day's latest does not lead the pack of her almost wordless picture books about the baby-sitting rottweiler Carl, but it nevertheless offers an idyllic vision to its readers. Carl and baby Madeleine are supposed to be napping when the neighborhood children approach the bedroom window and suggest a game of Follow the Leader. "You can be the leader!" they tell Carl amid the book's sole passage of text. Less mischievous than in his previous appearances (skipping out during naptime is Carl's only real prank here), the irresistible rottweiler conducts the children on a walk through suburban fields, pausing to lead them in stretching out their back legs, marching atop a short stone ledge, etc. With Madeleine riding Carl pony-style, they go to town, sit up and beg (successfully) for treats at a bakery and try out the revolving door of a well-stocked toy store. By the time Madeleine's mother comes to check on the nappers, everyone (including Carl's old friend the Irish terrier) is back in Madeleine's bedroom, striking sleeping-dog poses. Carl is at his doggiest: he has the kids rolling over, carrying sticks in their mouths and chasing a squirrel. Day's watercolors look so natural that it's possible to believe the story for a minute or two-certainly, the combination of grassy settings, friendly village shops and, of course, tender companionship adds up to an excursion virtually any reader would enjoy.

By the author of Tularosa. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Kevin Kerney might just be the best cop currently working the mean streets of mystery fiction. As deputy chief of the New Mexico State Police, he is not tortured by the doubts, angst, alcoholism, or mixed motives that seem to overwhelm many of his fictional colleagues. His methods are rarely flashy or excessively macho, and he treats other cops of all ranks with a minimum of attitude. Author Michael McGarrity, who worked for Santa Fe's sheriff's department before retiring to write, has managed to make Kerney human without loading him with excess baggage. <p> As we've come to realize in three previous books--<i>Mexican Hat</i>, <i>Serpent Gate</i>, and <i>Tularosa</i>--Kerney works as a police officer to make the money he needs to buy a cattle ranch like the one he grew up on. In <i>Hermit's Peak</i>, that dream comes closer to reality when a woman painter leaves Kerney a large portion of her own property on a mesa northeast of Santa Fe. McGarrity describes this land with the keen simplicity of natural poetry. Reality (in the form of a huge inheritance tax bill) darkens the picture. But the discovery of a very rare cactus plant and the unexpected arrival of Sara Brannon (the career army officer with whom Kerney had a romance in an earlier book) let in a few rays of sunlight. Meanwhile, Kerney and a tough local cop have to deal with a rape and murder, plus enough everyday crimes to keep them seriously busy without busting the boundaries of believability. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p><b>Michael McGarrity</b> is the author of <i>Tularosa,</i> nominated for an Anthony Award; <i>Mexican Hat;</i> and <i>Serpent Gate.</i> A former deputy sheriff for Santa Fe County, he established the first Sex Crimes Unit there and led it to award-winning status.

Examining this facet of Christianity from historical and sociological viewpoints, Marty lays bare the roots of this faith, in turn chronicling its success throughout the world.<br><br>Writing with great style, and providing impeccable interpretations of historical, canonical, and liturgical documents, Marty gives readers of all faiths and levels of familiarity with Christian practices and history a highly useful and supremely accessible primer. He depicts the life of Christ and his teachings and explains how the apostles set out to spread the Gospel. With a special emphasis on global Christianity, he shows how the religion emerged from its ancestral homelands in Africa, the Levant, and Asia Minor, was imported to Europe, and then spread from there to the rest of the world, most often via trade and conquest. While giving a broad overview, Marty also focuses on specific issues, such as how Christianity struggles with the polar tensions inherent to many of the faith&#x2019;s denominations, and how it attempts to reconcile some of its stances on armed conflict, justice, and dominion with the teachings of Christ.<br><br><i>The Christian World </i>is a chronicle of one of the great belief systems and its many followers. It&#x2019;s a magnificent story of emperors and kings, war and geography, theology and politics, saints and sinners, and the earthly battle to save souls. Above all, it&#x2019;s a remarkable testament to the teachings of Christ and how his message spreads around the globe to touch human experience everywhere.</p><p>Martin Marty was a member of the faculty at the University of Chicago&#x2013; where its institute for advanced studies in religion, the Martin Marty Center, is named for him&#x2013;for thirty-five years. He has written a number of seminal works on religion, especially <i>A Short History of Christianity</i>, and has received some seventy-five honorary doctorates. His awards include the National Book Award, the National Humanities Medal, and the Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He lives in Chicago with his wife.1.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Jewish<br> &nbsp;<br> Beginnings<br> &nbsp;<br> Yeshuanity&#x201d; or &#x201c;Jesusanity&#x201d; would be a natural name for a global community and culture devoted to Yeshua, or Jesus of Nazareth, depending on whether the namers favored his Hebrew or his Latinized name. &#x201c;Christianity&#x201d; is instead the designation, and its communal form is not the Jesus Church but the Christian Church. Nor is Christ the last name of this Jesus, but a translation of the Hebrew or Aramaic word messias, which means &#x201c;anointed,&#x201d; and refers to someone appointed to a specific role. To neglect or to obscure the meaning of the title Christ when applied to Jesus, the rabbi from Nazareth, is to miss the point of the earliest writings about him and to skew the story line ever after.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another World to Live in, and Its Stories<br> &nbsp;<br> The Christian World is an invitation for readers to enter and appraise a global scene, &#x201c;the world,&#x201d; through twenty centuries. At the same time the Christian &#x201c;world&#x201d; also means all the contexts to which Christian believers related and relate. &#x201c;Christianity&#x201d; may imply institutions and can be expressed through doctrines and ways of life, but at its core it is a story. Philosopher George Santayana connected &#x201c;world&#x201d; and &#x201c;story&#x201d; precisely, as will we. In Reason in Religion he remarked that &#x201c;every living and healthy religion has a marked idiosyncrasy.&#x201d; Ask atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Jews, or others to listen to Christians and they will soon discern the main &#x201c;marked idiosyncrasy&#x201d;: the devotion to Jesus Christ.<br> &nbsp;<br> As these listeners observe the effects of what they have heard they will note what Santayana told readers to look for, in this case it would mean that Christianity&#x2019;s &#x201c;power consists in its special and surprising message,&#x201d; rooted in the story of Jesus Christ, &#x201c;and in the bias which that revelation gives to life.&#x201d; Billions of people have let that revelation &#x201c;bias&#x201d; them, so that they could experience joy and peace or, conversely and often at the same time, face persecution, hardship, or even death in its light. Santayana spoke of &#x201c;the vistas&#x201d; a religion like Christianity opens, &#x201c;and the mysteries it propounds,&#x201d; and these will be obvious to all who follow the story. Now: taken together they make up &#x201c;another world to live in, and another world to live in&#x2014;whether we expect ever to pass wholly over into it or no&#x2014;is what we mean by having a religion.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Beginning with the Story of Jesus Christ<br> &nbsp;<br> The &#x201c;special and surprising message&#x201d; of Christianity begins with Jesus Christ, so if we wish to go back to beginnings, we begin with his story. The earliest Christians were, like Jesus, Jews. This means that they were schooled in Hebrew Scriptures, which Christians later called &#x201c;the Old Testament.&#x201d; They reread those Scriptures and gave them a &#x201c;special and surprising&#x201d; twist. Believers took words of the prophets and claimed that they foretold Jesus, or they told stories of scriptural figures like Moses and Elijah, Noah and Jonah, and saw them as &#x201c;types&#x201d; of Jesus Christ and his story.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jesus was a Jew: that theme needs reinforcing, especially because so much of Christian history is a wrestling with the meanings of Jews and Judaism. The two faiths should have been supportive of each other, as spiritual next of kin. Anthropologists stress what is obvious about kin: &#x201c;aggression, like charity, begins at home.&#x201d; As the upstart believers in Jesus Christ as the long-promised deliverer of Israel, the Messiah, the Christ, expressed that startling claim, some Jews who did not see him that way and who thought his claims blasphemous ejected the believers in Jesus Christ from their synagogues and persecuted them. For twenty centuries the once ejected Christians exacted revenge or, on any number of grounds, set out on their own to be separate, to define themselves over against those in their parent faith community, as they turned murderous in patterns for which there was little formal and corporate repentance until the late twentieth century.<br> &nbsp;<br> Getting the story of Jesus right is difficult, and no single interpretation can be satisfying to all 2.2 billion Christians, since they are divided into 38,000 denominations, many of them fashioned to protect and project separate tellings of the story. Yet certain elements of the story stand out. To begin with, the narratives about Jesus Christ were all written by followers, called disciples or evangelists, which means spreaders of the evangel, the &#x201c;good news.&#x201d; In these stories, he chose twelve followers to stand out, no doubt to mirror the twelve tribes of Israel. Four books in the Christian New Testament called gospels were named after three authors or editors who pursued parallel tracks, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, while a fourth, identified with John, displays different nuances and intentions. Not exactly biographies or histories, the gospels are narrative testimonies to what the early communities cherished and wanted preserved. Luke tells how he went about his work interviewing eyewitnesses, reading documentary collections, and giving them coherence in his own edited narrative. These gospels stress different aspects of the life and work of Jesus. Luke, for instance, was especially attentive to the marginalized, among them women and children. His Jesus was always at table with outcasts, and he showed special favor to lepers and the physically handicapped&#x2014;and thus despised&#x2014;people around him.<br> &nbsp;<br> In recent times some of the texts which had not been incorporated into what became the shared collection or canon have been discovered as far from Jerusalem as Egypt, where some communities which identified themselves with Jesus long struggled. Other such writings, long known but neglected, receive new attention. To overstate the case slightly, most of these gospels display difficulty with either the human Jesus the Jew or Jesus the exalted being they called Lord. Some pose the whole questions of God and Jesus in arcane, hard to interpret terms. No matter what the claims any of these made and whatever appeal they have now to scholars and seekers especially in the affluent West, for most Christians around the globe it is the four gospel accounts that have provided the focus for their faith, the enchantment of their stories, and the impulse for their ministries and service.<br> &nbsp;<br> From these gospels the later believing communities have learned how Christians, originally all of them Jews, related to Judaism itself. In the period in which the gospels were being written, the Romans put down a revolt by oppressed Jews. They besieged the city and destroyed the Second Temple, the center of Jewish worship. Most scholars see these traumatic events as elements in the shaping of the gospels. They are reflected in words of Jesus about persecution, death, destruction, and the foreseen end-time. Mainly, however, the gospels have been revered because they provided the story of Jesus&#x2019; birth, the account of what is called his Passion or suffering and dying, and most of all his Resurrection. Framed by those events is the story of his life<br> &nbsp;<br> Since Christians make so much of the figure of Jesus, it is impressive and, to many, confounding, that there is so much that they can never know. Archaeology may turn up artifacts that can be studied to color the understandings of the time, but &#x201c;the historical Jesus,&#x201d; as some scholars call him while pursuing his trail, will always remain a subject of controversy and confusion, always finally elusive. If he was &#x201c;the exalted Lord,&#x201d; did he claim to be the Son of God or even, clearly, the Anointed of God, the Messiah? Why did the gospels report that he on occasion called himself the Son of Man, a figure vivid in the imagination of some apocalyptic Jews who thrived before his time? How did he become such a cherished figure among those who value the family, while his own family had trouble believing in him and while he so often dismissed and rejected family ties for the sake of the &#x201c;Kingdom of God&#x201d; that he was announcing? What did he do from age twelve to approximately age thirty, years about which the gospels are silent and pseudo-gospels tell fanciful tales?</p><h2>Nutrition for Nursing Edition 6. 0</h2><p>NUTRITION FOR NURSING REVIEW MODULE - EDITION 6.0 - 2016 This review and study guide is an invaluable and complete overview of core content related to nutrition for nursing.

She wants to be a reporter, knowing full well that a few pieces published in the <i>Arlington News</i> will not suffice. Real reporters must go to Grand Places, and do Grand Things, like Hattie's hero Nellie Bly. Another girl might be stymied by this, but Hattie has faced down a hungry wolf and stood up to a mob of angry men. Nothing can squash her desire to write for a big city newspaper. A letter and love token from Uncle Chester's old flame in San Francisco fuels that desire and Hattie jumps at the opportunity to get there by working as a seamstress for a traveling acting troupe. This could be her chance to solve the mystery of her "scoundrel" uncle and, in the process, help her learn more about herself. But Hattie must first tell Charlie that she will not join him in Seattle. Even though her heart approves of Charlie's plan for their marriage, her mind fears that saying yes to him would be saying no to herself. Hattie holds her own in the big city, literally pitching her way to a byline, and a career that could be even bigger than Nellie Bly's. But can making headlines compensate for the pain of betrayal and lost love? Hattie must dig deep to find her own true place in the world.

Lit Guild Alt. IP.</p><p><i>"My weary mind turns for refreshment to the thought of you as a dusty traveller might sink onto a soft and grassy bank."</i> <p> These tender words, written by Gustave Flaubert to Louise Colet in 1853, offer just a hint of the rich collection of lovers' correspondence preserved in Michelle Lovric's <i>Love Letters: An Anthology of Passion</i>. This slim volume is overflowing with excerpted quotations that are artfully arranged around paintings and line drawings with a Victorian flair, and every passionate word is carefully attributed with names, dates, and details. But the excerpted quotations are only a fraction of the book's appeal: the real draw is the letters that Lovric tracked down and photographed in museums and libraries all over the world. In the tradition of Griffin and Sabine, these reproductions are tucked into envelopes and must be removed in order to be read. In this way, Lovric offers us a peek into the legendary relationships of Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett, and Dylan Thomas and his wife Caitlin, among others.

(Nobel Prize Winners Series). CIP. Lerner. 1987. PLB $9.95. Grade 5-9 Two entertaining and informa tive books. In The Disease Fighters , great medical research discoveries are outlined. These eight vignettes seem more like mystery stories than factual narratives. Beginning with Robert Kock and his work to cure tuberculosis (1905 Nobel Prize) through Enders, Weller, and Robbins and their experi ments leading to the development of a polio vaccine (1954), Aaseng reveals the brilliant schemes, lost opportuni ties, and strange turns of fate which have yielded the miracles of 20th-Cen tury medicine. The approach is anec dotal and not chronological. In The Peace Seekers, Aaseng gives a better overview of the prize's history. With portraits of such diverse figures as Jane Addams, Martin Luther King, Lech Walesa, and Bishop Tutu, Aaseng points out that peace advocates are of ten unpopular, persecuted, or even killed for their beliefs. Eight peace prize recipients are sketched; chapters are illustrated with well-chosen and provocative black-and-white photos. Both books should spark further read ing whether to explore the incredible chain of events which produced the wonder drug penicillin or to understand the tragic dilemma of the Soviet Union's Andrei Sakharov.

But life appears tranquil in the isolated farming settlement of Wapiti in northern Saskatchewan, where the Mennonite community continues the agricultural lifestyle their ancestors have practised for centuries. Their Christian values of peace and love lead them to oppose war and military service, so they are hardly affected by the war &#x2013; except for the fact that they are reaping the rewards of selling their increasingly valuable crops and livestock.<br><br>Thom Wiens, a young farmer and earnest Christian, begins to ask questions. How can they claim to oppose the war when their livestock become meat to sustain soldiers? How can they enjoy this free country but rely on others to fight to preserve that freedom? Within the community, conflicts and broken relationships threaten the peace, as the Mennonite tradition of close community life manifests itself as racism toward their &#x201c;half-breed&#x201d; neighbours, and aspirations of holiness turn into condemnation of others. Perhaps the greatest hope for the future lies with children such as Hal Wiens, whose friendship with the M�tis children and appreciation of the natural environment offer a positive vision of people living at peace with themselves and others.<br><br>Wiebe&#x2019;s groundbreaking first novel aroused great controversy among Mennonite communities when it was first published in 1962. Wiebe explains, &#x201c;I guess it was a kind of bombshell because it was the first realistic novel ever written about Mennonites in western Canada. A lot of people had no clue how to read it. They got angry. I was talking from the inside and exposing things that shouldn't be exposed.&#x201d; At the same time, other reviewers were unsure how to react to Wiebe&#x2019;s explicitly religious themes, a view which Wiebe found absurd. &#x201c;There are many, many people who feel that religious experience is the most vital thing that happens to them in their lives, and how many of these people actually ever get explored in modern novels?&#x201d;<br><br>The concept of peace is an important theme in Wiebe&#x2019;s first three books. The attempt to live non-violently, one of the basic tenets of the Mennonite faith as taught by the sixteenth-century spiritual leader Menno Simons, is what has &#x201c;caused the Mennonites the most difficulty in their relationship with everybody,&#x201d; forcing them to move again and again. The theme of peace versus passivity is further explored in The Blue Mountains of China, where inner peace, a state of being, is contrasted with the earthly desire for a place of public order and tranquility where the church is &#x201c;there for a few hours a Sunday and maybe a committee meeting during the week to keep our fire escape polished,&#x201d; as Thom, the protagonist puts it.. Wiebe has said, &#x201c;To be an Anabaptist is to be a radical follower of the person of Jesus Christ . . . and Jesus Christ had no use for the social and political structures of his day; he came to supplant them.&#x201d;<br><br>While <i>Peace Shall Destroy Many</i> takes place in a Mennonite community, its elements are universal, delineating the way young idealism rebels against staid tradition, as a son clashes with his father. In the face of violent confrontations between beliefs all over the world, the novel remains as compelling now as it was nearly forty years ago.</p><p>&#x201c;Thoughtfully conceived . . . . at times deeply moving . . . . it has elements of greatness . . . . Rudy Wiebe. . . . has the power of observation; and he has also the ability to understand human emotions, to grasp and interpret conflicting forces that dwell deep within the minds of outwardly calm and reticent people.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Books in ReviewCanadian Literature</i>Rudy Wiebe was born on October 4, 1934, in an isolated farm community of about 250 people in a rugged but lovely region near Fairholme, Saskatchewan. His parents had escaped Soviet Russia with five children in 1930, part of the last generation of homesteaders to settle the Canadian West, and part of a Mennonite history of displacement and emigration through Europe and Asia to North and South America since the seventeenth century. In 1947 his family gave up their bush farm and moved to Coaldale, Alberta, a town east of Lethbridge peopled largely by Ukrainians, Mennonites, Mormons, and Central Europeans, as well as Japanese, who ended up there during WW II.<br><br>Rudy Wiebe read as much as possible from an early age; his first reading materials were the Bible, the Eaton's catalogue and the <i>Free Press Weekly Prairie Farmer</i>; he also recalls listening to his parents&#x2019; stories of Russia. By Grade 4, he had read through the two shelves of books available in the one-room schoolhouse. Growing up, he enjoyed <i>Les Miserables</i>,<i> Toilers of the Sea</i>, <i>David Copperfield</i>, <i>Tom Brown's Schooldays</i>, Greek myths and Norse legends. Later an admirer of Faulkner, M�rquez, Borges and Tolstoy, Wiebe has always held to the fundamentals of plot, character and, above all, story. He believes stories should begin in the specific and local but expand into &#x201c;a human truth larger than any individual.&#x201d;<br><br>Wiebe won his first prize for fiction while studying literature at the University of Alberta, where he enrolled in a writing class and began producing poems, plays and stories. His winning story in a Canada-wide contest recounted a young boy&#x2019;s response to the death of his sister &#x2013; based on Wiebe&#x2019;s own experience &#x2013; and was published in the magazine <i>Liberty</i> in 1956. After earning his B.A., Wiebe left for the ancient University of T�bingen in West Germany on a Rotary Fellowship to study literature and theology, an experience that increased his respect for older and richer communities. Tena Isaak of British Columbia joined him there and they were married. The couple travelled in England, Austria, Switzerland and Italy before returning to Edmonton, where Wiebe completed his M.A. in creative writing. His thesis grew into his first novel, <i>Peace Shall Destroy Many</i>. <br><br>In 1962 Wiebe earned a Bachelor of Theology degree from the Mennonite Brethren Bible College; he considered becoming a minister. He was editor of Winnipeg&#x2019;s <i>Mennonite Brethren Herald</i> when <i>Peace Shall Destroy Many </i>was published. Many conservative ministers and Mennonites in small towns objected to the novel's frank and at times unflattering portrait of community life, and there was considerable opposition to the book. &#x201c;I wasn't exactly sacked as editor . . . but the committee came to me and said &#x2018;Ahem.&#x2019; I resigned.&#x201d; The strength of this reaction made him think hard about the power of the written word, and reinforced his sense of wanting to be a writer.<br><br>Wiebe then was invited to teach at a Mennonite college in Goshen, an agricultural town in Indiana with a large Mennonite and Amish population, where he would be Assistant Professor of English from 1963 to 1967. Goshen College was a lively and stimulating intellectual community where Wiebe committed himself to writing, study, teaching and travel. &#x201c;I encountered men and women of real perception . . . really literate Christians who saw themselves as Jesus's followers and at the same time were acquainted with the thoughts of others and had brought that kind of understanding to bear on what it means to be a Christian. The best thing that ever happened to me was the meetings we had every two or three weeks in one home or another &#x2013; seven or eight of us, a psychiatrist, a couple of theologians, a couple of literary people. There were the best theologians there, I think, the Mennonite Church has ever had.&#x201d; <br><br>Wiebe published his second novel, <i>First and Vital Candle</i>, and began to explore the western United States and the Mennonite settlements in Paraguay. He returned to Edmonton as a professor in creative writing and English at the University of Alberta, and immersed himself in Canadian literature. He wrote reviews, essays and articles, edited anthologies and was soon established as a major figure in Canadian letters. In 1973, his novel <i>The Temptations of Big Bear</i> won a Governor General's Award. Since then he has continued to win the highest praise for his books of fiction and non-fiction. He has written numerous film and television scripts, lectured internationally from Denmark to India, and given readings from Adelaide to Puerto Rico to Helsinki and Igloolik. For thirty years he taught literature and creative writing at colleges and universities in Canada, the United States and Germany. Now retired from teaching, his former students include such accomplished writers as Myrna Kostash, Aritha van Herk, Thomas Wharton and Katherine Govier.<br> <br>Wiebe was called the first major Mennonite writer to place his community&#x2019;s experience in a broader framework. Mennonites assert the fundamental authority of Scripture, especially the New Testament, as a practical guide to life. But while Wiebe imbues his work with a deep moral seriousness, his focus has always been on narrative. &#x201c;I never consciously think of writing a so-called Christian novel. I don&#x2019;t think Albert Camus ever thought of writing an existentialist novel, either. I think of getting at, of building, a story.&#x201d; As a prairie writer, he has often concerned himself with Native stories, feeling place of birth to be more important than blood ancestry. &#x201c;Those Mennonite villages in Russia are my heritage, but not my world. The world I feel and sense in my bones is the bush of northern Saskatchewan, of prairie Canada.&#x201d; Native spirituality, with its vital links to the physical world, has always attracted him. But his fiction manages to transcend nationality and locale to explore the struggles of communities and individuals; his books and stories have been translated into nine European languages, as well as Chinese, Japanese and Hindi.<br><br>Whatever Wiebe&#x2019;s focus in a given work, he has always chosen ambitious themes, and his work rewards readers with an intensity seldom rivalled. He is a voice of Canadian fiction that cannot be ignored, and whose work promises to endure.</p><h2>Pork &amp; Sons</h2><p>Presents original recipes for cooking pork, and includes insight into the history of the pig and those who raise them, and offers alternatives for hard-to-find ingredients.</p><p>Stephane Reynaud is co-owner of the restaurant Villa 9 Trois in Montreuil, just outside of Paris, France. <i>Pork &amp; Sons</i> is his first cookbook. <p> Jose Reis de Matos is an old friend of Stephane Reynaud and was responsible for the over 100 hand-drawn pig illustrations in <i>Pork &amp; Sons</i>.</p>"If you like all things porcine, this is the book for you...

Becoming Steve Jobs<i> </i>answers the central question about the life and career of the Apple cofounder and CEO: How did a young man so reckless and arrogant that he was exiled from the company he founded become the most effective visionary business leader of our time, ultimately transforming the daily life of billions of people?<br><br> Drawing on incredible and sometimes exclusive access, Schlender and Tetzeli tell a different story of a real human being who wrestled with his failings and learned to maximize his strengths over time. Their rich, compelling narrative is filled with stories never told before from the people who knew Jobs best, including his family, former inner circle executives, and top people at Apple, Pixar and Disney, most notably Tim Cook, Jony Ive, Eddy Cue, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, Robert Iger and many others. In addition, Schlender knew Jobs personally for 25 years and draws upon his many interviews with him, on and off the record, in writing the book. He and Tetzeli humanize the man and explain, rather than simply describe, his behavior. Along the way, the book provides rich context about the technology revolution we've all lived through, and the ways in which Jobs changed our world.<br><br> A rich and revealing account, <i>Becoming Steve Jobs</i> shows us how one of the most colorful and compelling figures of our times was able to combine his unchanging, relentless passion with an evolution in management style to create one of the most valuable and beloved companies on the planet.</p><p><b>BRENT SCHLENDER</b> is one of the premiere chroniclers of the personal computer revolution, writing about every major figure and company in the tech industry.

A recipient of the L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur from the French government for his cultural contributions, he has been living in Provence with his wife, Jennie, for more than twenty-five years.<i>Chapter&nbsp;1</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Why is it that bad news so often arrives on Monday mornings?<br> &nbsp;<br> The call came at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. local time, waking a reluctant Elena Morales from a deliciously deep sleep. It was her boss, Frank Knox, founder and CEO of Knox Insurance, and there was an undercurrent of tension in his voice. There was a problem, he said, and it was urgent. Despite the early-morning Los Angeles traffic, Elena was with him in his office by 7:30.<br> &nbsp;<br> For once, his normally cheerful manner had deserted him. &#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;ve read some of this stuff already,&#x201d; he said, opening the folder of newspaper clippings that was on his desk. &#x201c;These jewelry robberies in the South of France are getting worse every year. And now it&#x2019;s getting closer to home. A couple of hours ago, I had a call from our Paris office; one of their clients, Madame Castellaci, has just had a bunch of diamonds lifted from her house in Nice. She&#x2019;s hysterical, and the office in Paris has been sent a claim the size of the national debt.&#x201d; He paused to take a swig of coffee.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s our liability?&#x201d; Elena asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Knox&#x2019;s eyebrows went up, and he shook his head. &#x201c;We laid off as much of the risk as we could, but it&#x2019;s still going to hurt us.&#x201d; He took a deep breath. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking at seven figures. Two million, maybe three.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you reckon the claim&#x2019;s valid? What do the police say?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Knox shrugged. &#x201c;Not much. From what I&#x2019;ve been told, it seems to have been a professional job&#x2014;no clues, no prints, nothing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And what do our people in Paris say?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Help.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Knox slumped back in his chair. Elena had never seen him look so despondent. He was planning to retire in a few months and enjoy a prosperous retirement, after thirty-five years of hard work. And now this. Even with the money he&#x2019;d put away over the years, it was a blow.<br> &#x201c;Frank, what do you want me to do?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like you to get over to the Paris office and go through everything they know,&#x201d; Knox said after a deep sigh. &#x201c;And then I&#x2019;d like you to go down to Nice and grill the client.&#x201d; He held up one hand. &#x201c;I know, I know. The police will have done that, but sometimes they miss little things. It&#x2019;s a long shot, but it&#x2019;s all we&#x2019;ve got.&#x201d; He slid the folder of clippings across the desk. &#x201c;Here&#x2014;something to read on the plane. Good luck.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<br> Elena&#x2019;s feelings were mixed as she packed for the trip. Normally, she would be delighted to be going once again to France. This visit, however, was unlikely to offer much in the way of enjoyment. Her colleagues in the Paris office would be distracted and anxious, and if Madame Castellaci in Nice was anything like some of Knox&#x2019;s other clients, she would be bad-tempered and suspicious. Not for the first time, Elena was reminded of the irony of the insurance business. In theory, a mutually beneficial arrangement; in practice, a relationship in which, so often, each side distrusted the other. Cheating, misrepresentation, and blatant dishonesty&#x2014;she had seen them all.<br> &nbsp;<br> She tried to close her suitcase. As usual, it was overpacked; as usual, she had to sit on it to close the locks. She looked at her watch, saw that she had ten minutes before the car came to take her to the airport, and decided to call Sam Levitt, her partner in love and other&nbsp;adventures for the past several years. He was in Jamaica, &#x201c;consulting&#x201d; for his old friend Nathan, whose business&#x2014;smuggling Cuban cigars from Jamaica into the U.S.&#x2014;had run into a spot of trouble with one of the local protection rackets.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sam? Can you talk?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To you, my love, always.&#x201d; Even his voice sounded suntanned, Elena thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Listen&#x2014;something&#x2019;s come up at the office. I&#x2019;ve got to go to Paris this afternoon, and then Nice. It&#x2019;s a client who&#x2019;s put in a claim for stolen diamonds, and Frank wants me to check things out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You want me to come? I&#x2019;m nearly done here. Another day or two of twisting arms and kissing ass should do it. Why don&#x2019;t we meet in Marseille? I&#x2019;ll call Francis and tell him to expect us.&#x201d; Their good friend Francis Reboul had been a generous host over the years, and he was always happy to see them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That would be great. God, am I sick of the insurance business.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There was a pause before Sam&#x2019;s reply. &#x201c;Give it up. Send me out to work and become a lady of leisure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Elena was prevented from pursuing this seductive suggestion by the arrival of the driver. &#x201c;Got to go. I&#x2019;ll call you from Paris.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the car, she went over their brief conversation. Was Sam serious? She wasn&#x2019;t always sure. He had wanted her to come down to Jamaica with him, but work had made that impossible, a disappointment for them both. One day soon, she promised herself, you&#x2019;ve got to get a life. A new life. According to Air France, she had ten hours and forty-five minutes to think about it before arriving in Paris.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a small consolation, she was in business class. Comfortable surroundings and a decent glass of chilled Chablis restored her spirits enough to do a little homework, and she opened the folder of clippings that Frank Knox had given her.<br> &nbsp;<br> The thefts were listed in chronological order, starting in 2002 with&nbsp;a relatively modest haul, valued at three million euros, from a jeweler in Cannes. In 2005, two million from a jeweler in Saint-Tropez. In 2009, fifteen million from Cartier in Cannes. In 2010, seven million from a jewelry wholesaler near Marseille. In 2013, a million from the safe in a Cannes hotel bedroom, a two-million-euro necklace stolen during a celebrity party at the Cannes Film Festival, and, to top them all, one hundred and three million from an exhibition of &#x201c;Extraordinary Diamonds&#x201d; in, yet again, Cannes. Elena was shaking her head in disbelief as she put down the folder. All that money for fragments of what one article had described as metastable allotropes of carbon.<br> &nbsp;<br> Much to Sam&#x2019;s relief, Elena&#x2019;s taste in jewelry was limited to Mexican silver and old gold. She had seen far too many diamond necklaces on the wattled necks of elderly socialites, and this had effectively cured her of diamond envy. As she had once said to Sam, she would prefer to put that kind of money into something practical, like a town house in Paris and a Bentley. Or the house they had seen on their last visit to Marseille. A friend of Francis Reboul&#x2019;s had shown it to them: it was small, built in the early 1920s, and perched on a spur of rock. They had instantly fallen in love with it. The sweeping view of the Mediterranean was enough on its own, but there were other attractions. It was a short and picturesque walk from Reboul&#x2019;s home at Le Pharo, and an even shorter stroll would take them to the delights of Le Petit Nice, whose three Michelin stars made it Marseille&#x2019;s most decorated restaurant.<br> &nbsp;<br> The asking price for the house was, as Sam had said, enough to make a billionaire&#x2019;s eyes water. But they had to have it. Sam raided what he called his slush fund, Elena sold her stocks, and long-distance negotiations between L.A. and the owner&#x2019;s lawyer in Marseille began. And continued. And went on. And on. The problem was that the proprietor, a seventy-five-year-old widow from Paris, had thought it necessary to obtain the agreement of her extended family to the sale. Children had to be consulted. Grandchildren had&nbsp;to be considered. Even cousins, who under French law might have had some distant claim to the proceeds, could not be ignored. Back and forth went proposals and counterproposals between members of the family until Elena and Sam had almost given up.<br> &nbsp;<br> A ray of hope had finally come the previous week in the form of a letter from the owner&#x2019;s lawyer. It was possible that the sale could proceed as soon as he had received written confirmation he was awaiting from the family that the sale would not provoke legal complications. Sam had called Reboul with the news, and he had agreed to contact the lawyer and try to move things along. And that was where the matter stood, promising but unresolved.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoughts of the house turned to thoughts of the future. A place in Marseille, however idyllic it might be, was of little use to someone who was stuck in a Los Angeles office. Elena had often wondered how long she could put up with her job, even though it paid very well. These last two years, she would have left several times had it not been for her loyalty to Frank Knox. Now that he was retiring, Elena could leave with a clear conscience. Yes, she thought, Frank&#x2019;s retirement was definitely a signal for action. She closed her eyes and lay back in her seat, her head filled with thoughts of life with the Mediterranean as a neighbor.</p><h2>Edward Steichen: Lives in Photography</h2><p><p><strong>By far the most lavish, thoughtfully selected, and beautifully produced book of Steichen&#x2019;s work.</strong></p> Edward Steichen (1879-1973) is unquestionably one of the most prolific, influential, and indeed controversial names in the history of photography. He was admired by many for his achievements as a fine-art photographer, while impressing countless others with the force of his commercial accomplishments. The influence of his legendary exhibition, <em>The Family of Man</em>, is still felt. This volume traces Steichen&#x2019;s career trajectory from his Pictoralist beginnings to his time with Cond� Nast through his directorship of photography at the Museum of Modern Art. Hundreds of his photographs are reproduced in stunning four-color to reveal the complexities and nuances of these black-and-white images. Essays from a range of scholars explore his most important subjects and weigh his legacy. Contributors include A. D. Coleman, Joanna T. Steichen, and Ronald Gedrim. With a full bibliography and chronology, this is the most complete and wide-ranging volume on Steichen ever published. 250 tinted and four-color photographs</p><p><p><strong>Todd Brandow</strong> is the founding director of the Foundation for the Exhibition of Photography. He lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and in Paris.</p><p><strong>William A. Ewing</strong> has been an author, lecturer, curator of photography, and museum director for more than forty years. His many publications on photography include The Body (1994), Landmark (2014) and Edward Burtynsky: Essential Elements (2016).</p>Starred Review. With his prodigious range, versatility and output, Edward Steichen casts a long shadow in 20th-century photography, and this lushly produced book assesses his legacy. Wending through Steichen's 70-year career, the book presents his early, impressionistic black-and-white nudes and portraits of luminaries such as Rodin as well as atmospheric still lives and editorial fashion shots for <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Vanity Fair</i>. Steichen experimented and excelled in every genre of photography and even his most commercial work shows more aesthetic consideration than product placement. The images are accompanied by insightful essays from a number of expert critics and curators, all of whom place Steichen in his proper context as one of the most influential and controversial artists of his time, alternately reviled as a parvenu and lauded as the Leonardo of photography. This book nimbly navigates divergent critical responses and brilliantly encapsulates the innovations and transformations of this pioneer of modern photography. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. 1839. Not illustrated. Excerpt: ... The ecclesiastical history of Eusebius Pamphilus Eusebius (of Caesarea, Bishop of Caesarea) NOTICE. The edition of Eusebius here offered to the public, is the first that has been issued in this country. It had its origin in the want of health, to sustain the ordinary labours of the ministry, and a wish to promote the knowledge, and advance the cause of religion. The nature of the work, and the estimation in which it has usually been held by the learned and pious, sanction the measure the publisher was induced to adopt, as being well calculated to answer the design. Circumstances attending the rise and early progress of Christianity, in a great measure peculiar to the character, condition, and wants of an infant Institution, established by divine authority, and protected to its completion by evident tokens of the divine presence and approbation, highly interesting in their nature, and extremely important to be known, invest the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius, (especially as it succeeds immediately to the Acts of the Apostles, and is for a considerable period the only work of the kind,) with a degree of value, to subsequent ages, that no other uninspired document is entitled to claim. The undersigned is firmly persuaded that its extensive circulation will, as it furnishes the means in a good degree of comparing modern with primitive times, and of viewing them in contrast with each other, tend to increase useful knowledge, promote soundness and unity in the faith, advance the cause of the church, and maintain peace and quietness among all Christian people.

Covering the full &#x201c;life cycle,&#x201d; historian Daina Ramey Berry shows the lengths to which enslavers would go to maximize profits and protect their investments. Illuminating &#x201c;ghost values&#x201d; or the prices placed on dead enslaved people, Berry explores the little-known domestic cadaver trade and traces the illicit sales of dead bodies to medical schools.<br><br>This book is the culmination of more than ten years of Berry&#x2019;s exhaustive research on enslaved values, drawing on data unearthed from sources such as slave-trading records, insurance policies, cemetery records, and life insurance policies. Writing with sensitivity and depth, she resurrects the voices of the enslaved and provides a rare window into enslaved peoples&#x2019; experiences and thoughts, revealing how enslaved people recalled and responded to being appraised, bartered, and sold throughout the course of their lives. Reaching out from these pages, they compel the reader to bear witness to their stories, to see them as human beings, not merely commodities.<br><br>A profoundly humane look at an inhumane institution, <i>The Price for Their Pound of Flesh</i> will have a major impact how we think about slavery, reparations, capitalism, nineteenth-century medical education, and the value of life and death.<br><br><b>Winner of the 2018 Hamilton Book Award &#x2013; from the University Coop (Austin, TX)</b><br><br><b>Winner of the 2018 Society for Historians of the Early American Republic Book Prize (SHEAR)</b><br><br><b>Winner of the 2018 Phillis Wheatley Literary Award, from the Sons and Daughters of the US Middle Passage</b><br><br><b>Finalist for the 2018 Frederick Douglass Book Prize from Yale University&#x2019;s Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition</b></p><p><b>Daina Ramey Berry</b> is an associate professor of history and African and African diaspora studies, and the Oliver H.

From the cradle to the grave and beyond, enslavers priced black bodies based on their imagined fitness for labor, sexual exploitation, use as collateral, and even their value after death as dissection cadavers. In horrific detail, Berry shows that there was a price tag placed on every pound of flesh. She also shows the efforts of enslaved people to assert that their lives had values beyond the money that could be rendered from their muscles and extracted from their bones. Out of the certainty that their souls were pearls beyond price, black people fought to make room for their own system of human values.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Edward E.

Some of the retellings, limited to a half-page or less, merely paraphrase the Revised Standard Version of the Bible, which when taken out of context leave too many unanswered questions. What is Hannah thinking as she relinquishes her beloved only son and must be content with an annual visit? Sarah laughs to hear that she will conceive-but what of Hagar? Mary of Nazareth has her Annunciation (oddly specified to have occurred in June, though the traditional date is March 9th), but her role is diminished to this one event. The stories are arranged chronologically, so there's no sense of the importance of Rebekah, as compared to the Queen of Sheba (who has the last word in the Hebrew-here called the "Old" Testament section). The full-color tapestrylike oil paintings on every page depict some of the women as old or plain, an improvement over romanticized stereotypes, but little else will make readers feel connected to these heroines.<br><i>Patricia Lothrop-Green, St. George's School, Newport, RI</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Using a tapestry theme to intertwine the lives of Biblical women from the Old and New Testaments, Sanderson's (Papa Gatto) intricate illustrations and involving storytelling reveal how each of the women featured wove beauty and purpose into her life. Thirteen Old Testament figures make their way into this text, including Eve, Sarah, Rahab, Jael, Abigail and Bathsheba, while 10 prominent women from the New Testament appear, including Mary of Nazareth, Anna, Procula, Lydia, Phoebe and Tabitha. Sanderson's colorfully detailed sketches are so convincing that readers may well mistake them for genuine tapestry weavings. The artist deftly matches the mood of her elegant tapestries with the characters of the Biblical women profiled. Each tale, enlivened with dialogue, and paired with an elegant portrait, allows readers to visualize the choices these women made and for which they will long be remembered.

Knowlson brilliantly re-creates Beckett's early years as a struggling author in Paris, his travels through Germany in 1936-37 as the Nazis were consolidating their power, his service in the French Resistance during World War II, and the years of literary fame and financial success that followed the first performance of his controversial Waiting for Godot (1953).<br>Paris between the wars was a city vibrant with experimentation, both in the arts and in personal lifestyle, and Knowlson introduces us to the writers and painters who, along with the young Beckett, populated this bohemian community. Most notable was James Joyce, a fellow Irishman who became Beckett's friend and mentor and influenced him to devote his life to writing. We also meet the women in Beckett's life - his domineering mother, May; his cousin Peggy Sinclair, who died at a tragically young age; Ethna MacCarthy, his first love, whom he immortalized in his poetry and prose; Peggy Guggenheim, the American heiress and patron of the arts; and the strong and independent Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil, whom he met in the late 1930s and married in 1961.<br>Beyond recounting many previously unknown aspects of the writer's life, including his strong support for human rights and other political causes, Knowlson explores in fascinating detail the roots of Beckett's works. He shows not only how the relationship between Beckett's own experiences and his work became more oblique over time, but also how his startling postmodern images were inspired by the paintings of the Old Masters, such as Antonello da Messina, Durer, Rembrandt, and Caravaggio.</p><p>Samuel Beckett, a talent so exceptional that he created masterpieces in both French and English, shied away from the limelight for much of his life. However James Knowlson, in this amazing biography, shows Beckett wasn't entirely hesitant to talk about himself; the book relies heavily on interviews with Beckett to reconstruct the writer's dizzying career. Knowlson fills the pages with exhaustive detail--some major, some minor. In addition, he analyzes the influences on and evolution of Beckett's work. Through it all a larger picture emerges, one of the artist at work and in life. <b>Damned to Fame</b> is a necessary addition to any study of Beckett.James Knowlson is the founder of the Beckett Archive (now the Beckett International Foundation) at the University of Reading, where he holds a Personal Chair of French.</p><h2>Greater: Dream Bigger.

Either way, I got downright introspective. I was<br>wrestling with a tension: <br><br>Steve Jobs was a great man. He changed the world through technology.<br><br>I&#x2019;m a pastor. I have a mission to change the world through the gospel.<br><br>But am I really achieving that mission? I&#x2019;m doing well by some standards, I guess.<br><br>I love Jesus. I have integrity. I love my family.<br><br>But still...<br><br>I&#x2019;m not redefining an industry. I&#x2019;m not accomplishing one of the greatest feats in human history. So what am I really doing? That matters? That will matter?<br><br>That will set my life apart?<br><br>In short, I was processing the nauseating feeling that, when I stack it all up, I don&#x2019;t feel like I&#x2019;m anything close to being the great man of God I want to be. Some days, actually, I feel like I sort of suck as a Christian. I didn&#x2019;t tweet any of that. But I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking it.<br><br>I&#x2019;m guessing you&#x2019;ve had thoughts like that too. I&#x2019;m not saying you want to be the next Steve Jobs or build your own<br>technology empire. But I think we all have these honest&nbsp;moments when we&#x2019;re gripped by a desire to feel that what we&#x2019;re doing matters more. That who we are matters more. A few hours later, after I tucked my boys into bed and<br>prayed for them, I sat on my bed and opened my MacBook.<br><br>For some reason I felt compelled to pull up a certain Bible verse. It&#x2019;s one of the most staggering statements Jesus ever made.<br><br>I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. (John 14:12)<br><br>I&#x2019;d read that verse so many times. But I had a new context for it.<br><br>And it sliced me with the edge of fresh challenge. Greater things than Jesus, the greatest man who ever lived? What does that even mean? How can we do greater things than Jesus?<br><br>Does it mean that we&#x2019;re able to do more powerful miracles than Jesus? Have a bigger impact than Jesus? I don&#x2019;t think so. After all, I don&#x2019;t know many people who have walked on water, multiplied fish and loaves to feed thousands, opened the eyes of the blind, or given salvation to the world.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re looking to be greater than Jesus, put down your crack pipe, my friend. That&#x2019;s not happening.<br><br>By leaving and then sending His Spirit to dwell inside His followers&#x2014;ordinary people like you and me&#x2014;Jesus released a<br>greater power for us to do extraordinary things on an extraordinary scale. The kinds of things the early church saw and did.<br><br>The kinds of things He still wants to do today through us. Jesus isn&#x2019;t calling us to be greater than He is.<br><br>He&#x2019;s calling us to be greater with Him through His Spirit within us.<br><br>Meant for More<br><br>As I tried to process the brain-bending implications of that claim, I thought through some conversations I&#x2019;d had recently with people who were feeling disappointed and stuck in their relationship with God and their place in life.<br><br>I&#x2019;m meeting more and more believers who are unsatisfied with the kind of Christians they&#x2019;re becoming and the version of the Christian life they&#x2019;re experiencing. These aren&#x2019;t bad people. They aren&#x2019;t gangbangers and ungodly pagans. If they were, their discontent would make more sense.<br><br>The thing is, most believers aren&#x2019;t in imminent danger of ruining their lives. They&#x2019;re facing a danger that&#x2019;s far greater:<br>wasting them.<br><br>These are some of the very people Jesus talked about in John 14:12. People who are supposed to be doing greater works than&#x2014;forget about Steve Jobs&#x2014;Jesus Christ Himself.<br><br>Yet it&#x2019;s not happening. For most of us, the experience of our daily lives is a far cry from the greater works Jesus talked about in John 14:12. Or even the achievements of a luminary like Steve Jobs.<br><br>We&#x2019;ve had some big dreams about what God might want for our lives. But so many of us are stuck in the starting blocks. Or are dragging along at the back of the pack.<br><br>We know we were meant for more. Yet we end up settling for less.<br><br>We&#x2019;re frustrated about where we are. But we&#x2019;re confused about how to move forward.<br><br>I wonder if you can relate.<br><br>What a life...</p><h2>The Humor of Christ</h2><p>The Humor of Christ inspires Christians to redraw their pictures of Christ and to add a persistent biblical detail, the note of humor. Throughout the Gospels, Christ employed humor for the sake of truth and many of his teachings, when seen in this light, become brilliantly clear for the first time. Irony, satire, paradox, even laughter itself help clarify Christ&#39;s famous parables, His brief sayings, and important events in His life.

At the age of twenty-one, he left home to make the holy pilgrimage to Mecca. This was only the first of a series of extraordinary journeys that spanned nearly three decades and took him not only eastward to India and China but also north to the Volga River valley and south to Tanzania. The narrative of these travels has been known to specialists in Islamic and medieval history for years. Ross E. Dunn&#39;s 1986 retelling of these tales, however, was the first work of scholarship to make the legendary traveler&#39;s story accessible to a general audience. Now updated with revisions, a new preface, and an updated bibliography, Dunn&#39;s classic interprets Ibn Battuta&#39;s adventures and places them within the rich, trans-hemispheric cultural setting of medieval Islam.</p><p><b>Ross E.

The images are bright and crisp, though most of what the authors photographed was dingy and covered with graffiti; quite a few fronts and signs were falling apart or grungy to begin with. Yet it is in this state of decay that the stores hold a curious fascination indeed, a raw beauty for anyone concerned with vernacular design. I was particularly taken with the Lower East Side remnants that are slowly being squeezed out by hip restaurants and shops. Zelig Blumenthal s religious articles store, on Essex Street, appears not to have changed since my grandparents lived nearby. The Hebrew lettering on the window is as clean as it was back then. Meanwhile, at Rabbi M. Eisenbach's shop, the painted signs seem to be fading.

These unfussy, elegant, and richly colored photographs of butcher shops, bakeries, fabric wholesalers, cuchifritos stands, stationery and sporting-goods stores, laundromats, groceries, and dive bars give connoisseurs of signage, folk typography, and ambient erosion much to pour over. Shops that opened in the 1970s now look as ancient as those dating back to the twenties. The tone is elegiac as much as it is celebratory; interviews with shop owners make it clear how close to extinction many of them stand, and the photographers report that nearly a third of these businesses have gone under in the time that it took to make the book."<br> <i>- The New Yorker</i> Copyright �2008</p><h2>Any Day Now (Sullivan&#39;s Crossing, 2)</h2><p><strong>Look for Robyn&#x2019;s new book, <em>The Best of Us</em>, a story about family, second chances and choosing to live your best life&#x2014;order your copy today!</strong><b>The highly anticipated sequel to #1 </b><em><b>New York Times</b></em><b> bestselling author Robyn Carr's </b><em><b>What We Find</b></em><b> transports readers back to Sullivan's Crossing.

The early <i>Saturday Night Live</i> cast member and writer does at least two tricks. Out in public, he plays Father Guido Sarducci, a priest-caricature given to excruciating monologues on such matters as the bill for the last lunch. At home, he plays Lazlo Toth, writer of impertinent letters to political celebrities and big businesses. Typical Lazlo missives are the ones in this third collection of them complaining to Delta Air Lines on the assumption that the company has something to do with the Delta Partners that keeps him waiting for the crown for a broken tooth. Only the occasional insult in the letters is funny (e.g., Monica Lewinsky can't get a date except with a man who can't leave the house alone), so most of the book's laughs arise from the lameness of the replies Lazlo receives. No pol or business will risk telling a fool he's a fool. Hawking by Novello's fellow TV geeks will boost initial interest in this surefire next-year's-garage-sale item.

Winston Churchill was the greatest war leader Britain ever had. In 1940, the nation rallied behind him in an extraordinary fashion. But thereafter, argues Max Hastings, there was a deep divide between what Churchill wanted from the British people and their army, and what they were capable of delivering. Himself a hero, he expected others to show themselves heroes also, and was often disappointed. It is little understood how low his popularity fell in 1942, amid an unbroken succession of battlefield defeats. Some of his closest colleagues joined a clamour for him to abandon his role directing the war machine. Hastings paints a wonderfully vivid image of the Prime Minister in triumph and tragedy. He describes the &#39;second Dunkirk&#39; in 1940, when Churchill&#39;s impulsiveness threatened to lose Britain almost as many troops in north-west France as had been saved from the beaches; his wooing of the Americans, and struggles with the Russians. British wartime unity was increasingly tarnished by workers&#39; unrest, with many strikes in mines and key industries. By looking at Churchill from the outside in, through the eyes of British soldiers, civilians and newspapers, and also those of Russians and Americans, Hastings provides new perspectives on the greatest Englishman. He condemns as folly Churchill&#39;s attempt to promote mass uprisings in occupied Europe, and details &#39;Unthinkable&#39;, his amazing 1945 plan for an Allied offensive against the Russians to liberate Poland. Here is an intimate and affectionate portrait of Churchill as Britain&#39;s saviour, but also an unsparing examination of the wartime nation which he led and the performance of its armed forces.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2010</strong> <i>Winston's War</i> is a brilliant tribute to the leadership of Winston Churchill during the bleakest hours of World War II. Employing an oratory genius that awed proponents and critics alike, the British Prime Minister fortified national pride and resolve by remaining fiercely defiant in the face of a powerful Axis war machine. Yet historian Max Hastings provides more than just a look at the inner workings of one man, as he extends beyond the words of the dynamic leader to portray an honest account of the emotions that defined Great Britain during the 1940's. Contrary to what his gilded legacy may lead future generations to believe, Churchill did not cement his place in history by winning unanimous public support. Rather, he achieved his iconic status by empowering "millions to look beyond the havoc of the battlefield...and perceive a higher purpose in their struggles and sacrifices." <i>--Dave Callanan</i> <p></p> <strong>Lynne Olson Reviews <em>Winston's War</em></strong><br><br> <b>Lynne Olson, a former Moscow correspondent for the <i>Associated Press</i> and White House correspondent for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, is the author of <em>Citizens of London</em>, <em>Troublesome Young Men</em>, <em>Freedom&#x2019;s Daughters</em> and co-author, with her husband, Stanley Cloud, of <em>A Question of Honor</em> and <em>The Murrow Boys</em>. She lives in Washington, D.C.</b> <p> </p> <p>British historian Max Hastings has entered a very crowded field with <i>Winston&#x2019;s War</i>, his new book about Winston Churchill&#x2019;s direction of the British effort in World War II. Hastings, the author of the acclaimed military histories <em>Armageddon</em> and <em>Retribution</em>, readily acknowledges the problem, noting that no human being has been written about more than Churchill. Yet he accomplishes what he has set out to do--provide an insightful, compelling portrait of the political outcast who came to power at the gravest moment in his country&#x2019;s history and, over the course of a desperate summer, rallied the British to stand alone against Hitler.</p> <p>Hastings is clear-eyed about Churchill&#x2019;s not inconsiderable shortcomings as a warlord, including a penchant for rash, ill-thought-out raids and other military operations "more appropriate to a Victorian cavalry subaltern than to the director of a vast industrial war effort." Yet, as he points out, that same capacity for boldness enabled Churchill--one of the few British prime ministers ever to have fought in a war himself--to spur into action not only his demoralized countrymen but also Britain&#x2019;s sclerotic military establishment, whose fortress mentality was the bane of his wartime existence. </p> <p>Equally important was Churchill&#x2019;s assiduous courtship of the American people and their president, Franklin D. Roosevelt. While the prime minister&#x2019;s relationship with Roosevelt was never as close as Churchill later claimed, he exerted a sizable influence on FDR&#x2019;s decisionmaking early in the war, including the critical decision to launch a 1942 invasion of North Africa, rather than the premature assault on France that the U.S. military brass had been urging--an attack that almost certainly would have ended in disaster. </p> <p>In the last two years of the conflict, however, the prime minister&#x2019;s influence in Washington waned dramatically. To his considerable pain and alarm, Roosevelt paid far more heed to the wishes and demands of Stalin and the Soviets than to Churchill and the British, who now were consigned to junior partnership in the Grand Alliance. Yet Hastings makes a convincing case that Churchill&#x2019;s still-commanding stature in the United States helped maintain Britain&#x2019;s status as a key, if diminished, player during the war&#x2019;s endgame--a time when this exhausted country could easily have been pushed into the shadows as "a backwater, supply center and aircraft carrier for American-led armies in Europe."</p> <p>Above all, though, Churchill will be remembered for his clarion calls of defiance and hope in the summer of 1940, almost singlehandedly changing the mood of his nation and rousing the British to fight on in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. "Gradually we came under the spell of that wonderful voice and inspiration," one London woman later wrote. "His stature grew larger and larger, until it filled our sky."</p> (Photo � Stanley Cloud)<br> <br> <p><strong>Max Hastings on <em>Winston's War</em></strong></p> <p></p> <p>Why another Churchill book? We have been told more about him than any other human being. Most of my own research for this book has been done not in the Churchill papers, gutted by historians, but among military and civilian diaries, newspaper files, British, American and Russian records. What I have tried to do is to portray the story of Churchill at war in the context of his relationships with the British and American peoples, the armed forces, the Russians. All these were more complex than is sometimes acknowledged.</p> <p>It is easy to identify his strategic errors and misplaced enthusiasms. Yet the outcome justified all. The defining fact of Churchill&#x2019;s leadership was Britain&#x2019;s emergence from the war among the victors. No warlord, no commander, in history has failed to make mistakes. It is as easy to catalogue the errors of Alexander the Great, Caesar, Napoleon as those of Churchill. He towers over the war, standing higher than any other single human being at the head of the forces of light. Without him, Britain&#x2019;s part would have seemed pretty small by VE-Day. Russia and the United States had played the dominant parts. No honourable course of action existed which could have averted his nation&#x2019;s bankruptcy and exhaustion in 1945, its eclipse from world power.</p> <p>Churchill did not command the confidence of all the British people all of the time. But his rhetoric empowered millions to look beyond the havoc of the battlefield, the squalor of their circumstances amid privation and bombardment, and to perceive a higher purpose in their struggles and sacrifices. This was, of course, of greater importance in 1940-41 than later, when the allies could commit superior masses of men and material to securing victory. But Churchill&#x2019;s words remain a lasting force in causing the struggle against Hitler to be perceived by posterity as &#x2018;the good war&#x2019;. </p> <p>He cherished aspirations which often proved greater than his nation was capable of fulfilling, which is one of my central themes. But it is inconsistent to applaud his defiance of reason in insisting that Britain must fight on in June 1940, and denounce the extravagance of his later demands upon its people and armed forces. Service chiefs often deplored his misjudgements and intemperance. Yet his instinct for war was much more highly developed than their own.</p> <p>History must take Churchill as a whole, as his wartime countrymen were obliged to do, rather than employ a spoke shave to strip away the blemishes created by his lunges into excess and folly, which were real enough. If the governance of nations in peace is best conducted by reasonable men, in war there is a powerful argument for leadership by those sometimes willing to adopt courses beyond the boundaries of reason, as Churchill did in 1940-41. His foremost quality was strength of will. This was so fundamental to his triumph in the early war years, that it seems absurd to suggest that he should have become more biddable, merely because in 1943-45 his stubbornness was sometimes deployed in support of misjudged purposes. </p> <p>As he left Chequers for the last time in July 1945, he wrote in its visitor&#x2019;s book: &#x2018;FINIS.&#x2019; Three weeks later, on 15 August, Japan&#x2019;s surrender brought an end to the Second World War. Churchill was among the greatest actors upon the stage of affairs the world has ever known. Familiarity with his speeches, conversation and the fabulous anecdotage about his wartime doings, does nothing to diminish our capacity to be moved to awe, tears, laughter by the sustained magnificence of his performance. He has become today a shared British and American legend. If his leadership was imperfect, no other British ruler in history has matched his achievement nor, please God, is ever likely to find himself in circumstances to surpass it.</p>Max Hastings is the author of more than twenty books, most recently <i>Retribution</i>.

I&#x2019;ve kidnapped the wrong man.</i></p> <p><i>Twenty-four hours earlier&nbsp;&#x2026; </i></p> <p>Muddy water spattered high onto the chipped and scratched enamel of the carriage&#x2019;s exterior. Punishing rain immediately washed the majority of it right back down onto the sodden, rutted road. Though the sun stood only a few hours after noon, one could not tell time because there was almost no daylight at all piercing the heavy black clouds.</p> <p>Lord Aaron Arbogast, grandson and heir of the Earl of Arbodean, drove the carriage through the storm with capable, callused hands. How strange to remember that when he&#x2019;d left England nearly ten years previously, he&#x2019;d never driven himself in anything but a sporting curricle. He certainly wouldn&#x2019;t have dreamed of exposing his lazy highborn hide to actual weather!</p> <p>Now he thought nothing of the torrent beating down on his drooping hat, borrowed from his manservant Hastings, except to wistfully recall that the rainwater in the Bahamian Islands was never this cold.</p> <p>His oilcloth driver&#x2019;s cape was borrowed from Hastings as well, for his own wool finery was wrapped around his shivering, feverish servant, who was tucked up safe and warm inside the once luxurious but now somewhat scruffy-looking carriage.</p> <p>It had taken far too much of his savings to purchase the conveyance in London, but once his ship had reached port Lord Aaron had wished to escape the city of his youthful downfall as quickly and as surreptitiously as possible.</p> <p>Everything had cost more than it ought to&#x2014;the two passages on the not-terribly-comfortable freight ship for himself and Hastings, the posh togs that had ended up wrapping the wiry Hastings to keep him warm, the aged carriage and the not-quite-matched, not-quite-shiny pair of horses to pull it.</p> <p>Behind the conveyance there even plodded a &#x201c;gentleman&#x2019;s mount,&#x201d; a rangy bay gelding of dubious descent and sullen temperament, but with long legs and a surprisingly fine gait, who, because of his problematic outlook on his servitude to mankind, had cost Aaron little more than meat market coin. Literally. The beast had been on his way to the knackery when Aaron had noticed the aristocratic lilt to his equine step. Outbidding the butcher at that point had been a matter of a few farthings.</p> <p>In the last ten years, Aaron had come to believe in the reformative power of the second chance.</p> <p>All of this was purely intended to make a good impression on his grandfather, whom he&#x2019;d not seen since the day &#x201c;Black Aaron&#x201d; was banished from England for his poor judgment years ago.</p> <p><i>Is that what we&#x2019;re calling it now? Poor judgment? The girl died!</i></p> <p>Aaron flinched at the accusing voice in his own mind. He had paid for that terrible mistake over the last decade, although even ten years in the sweltering tropics could not bring Amelia back to life.</p> <p>Such enforced exile had been his grandfather&#x2019;s only recourse. Aaron knew that. The crime that had driven his only family to reject him across three continents had been so unforgivable that it had taken every day of those ten years to slowly and steadily rebuild his personal sense of honor.</p> <p>His reputation, sadly, remained unsalvageable.</p> <p>If the old earl were not so ill, Aaron might not have drummed up the courage to return even then.</p> <p>However, if his grandfather was indeed as ill as Aaron&#x2019;s aunt&#x2019;s message stated, this would be Aaron&#x2019;s last opportunity to plead his case and claim his full heir status at last. For the title and estate were entailed, and none could take them from him, no matter his social odor&#x2014;but try managing all those square miles without the wealth or standing that his grandfather&#x2019;s forgiveness would give him.</p> <p>If he could get to Derbyshire in time, he might, just possibly, perhaps, prove to his grandfather that he was a changed man. He had brought letters of recommendation from respectable gentlemen, his grandfather&#x2019;s steward on the isles, and the local magistrate. Those missives, safely wrapped in oilcloth and tucked deep into Aaron&#x2019;s baggage, were his proof and his talisman. Perhaps all his hard work at redemption had not been in vain.</p> <p>During a lull in the slashing rain and booming thunder, Aaron heard another explosive sneeze from his suffering servant. He flipped open the trap and gazed down into the carriage from his high seat. Hastings blinked miserably up at him, a pale face splotched with feverish cheeks and a spectacularly red nose visible in the wildly rocking light of the interior lantern, and sniffed pitiably.</p> <p>&#x201c;I need soup, ye rotten toff,&#x201d; Hastings informed Aaron in thick Cockney tones. &#x201c;Soup and a bed, one wi&#x2019; real blankets and all!&#x201d;</p> <p>Lord Aaron Arbogast, a man who in his decadent youth had once knocked a footman unconscious for a barely audible snicker, merely nodded in sympathy at his loyal, ex-thief servant. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have it, my friend, as soon as we find that inn. Are you certain it is on this road somewhere?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Aye!&#x201d; Seized by a fit of coughing brought on by his vehemence, Hastings dissolved into petulant mutters. &#x201c;Good thing &#x2019;e&#x2019;s a toff, for he&#x2019;d never last a moment as a workin&#x2019; bloke!&#x201d;</p> <p>Aaron let the trap fall closed, for the rain had increased and he didn&#x2019;t want Hastings to get any wetter or any colder than the poor man already was. Gripping the reins more tightly in his hands, ignoring the gasping chill of the rain hitting his body, he gently urged the weary horses just a bit faster.</p> <p>When the inn emerged from the gloom, its windows glowing yellow and welcoming through the blue English dusk, Aaron let out a yell of pleasure and gave the horses one last lick of the reins across their backs. The pair scarcely needed it, for they well knew where good grain and warm hay came from. The carriage rattled into the cobbled yard of the inn, and Aaron was grateful to see the groom&#x2019;s boy run into the rain to take the horses by the lead.</p> <p>Gesturing to a stout fellow he took to be the innkeeper, Aaron drew in his assistance in getting Hastings from the carriage. The innkeeper shook his head at Hastings&#x2019;s illness.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oy, your poor master looks bad, lad! Want I ought to send for the village physic? He isn&#x2019;t much, just a tooth-puller, really, not near good enough for a fine lord, but he knows a fair bit about a fever.&#x201d;</p> <p>Aaron hesitated at the innkeeper&#x2019;s mistake, then nodded, tugging the brim of his dripping hat in a respectful gesture. &#x201c;Aye, sir. I&#x2019;d be right grateful if ye did.&#x201d; In Aaron&#x2019;s coat of fine dark wool trimmed in gold braid, fit for the Prince Regent&#x2019;s Court, Hastings looked the very picture of an ill nobleman. Aaron&#x2019;s boots were finer, but both men were mud to the knees so it wasn&#x2019;t likely anyone would note it. Hastings would get the best of care if the inn staff thought him a wealthy gentleman.</p> <p>Together the innkeeper and the boy began to carry the limp and shivering manservant indoors. Aaron let out a deep sigh as he gazed longingly up the muddy road.</p> <p>So close. The Arbodean estate was a mere half day&#x2019;s journey north. There was no help for it. He could not abandon Hastings until he was sure his man was well set. Once he found them rooms, he would send a message to his aunt that he would be delayed.</p> <p>Aaron went back to the carriage to retrieve their baggage, little though it was. Then, as he turned back toward the inn, he glanced upward into the most beautiful green-blue eyes he&#x2019;d ever seen.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Elektra Worthington glanced up from her novel as her brother Lysander entered the private dining room they&#x2019;d overtaken at the Green Donkey Inn. The innkeeper hadn&#x2019;t offered it for their use. He likely didn&#x2019;t even realize they were using it, but Ellie knew from long experience that a smile and an assumption were as good as permission. Especially out here, nearly to the wilds&#x2014;relative to London&#x2014;of Shropshire.</p> <p>Now, after they&#x2019;d finished their beef and greens, her brother Lysander had become restless as usual. Zander couldn&#x2019;t be still if he wasn&#x2019;t eating or sleeping&#x2014;and even then the entire Worthington household was sometimes woken by his nightmares.</p> <p>Not as often now, of course. He was much better than the mostly silent, sometimes howling, shell of a man who had returned from the war against Napoleon. He wasn&#x2019;t nearly so thin for one thing, though his restlessness did tend to keep him well honed. And he did speak now&nbsp;&#x2026; at least, occasionally.</p> <p>At the moment, however, he simply gazed at her meaningfully. Fortunately, as a Worthington, Elektra was a native speaker of the Cagey Clue. &#x201c;Something I should know?&#x201d; Saving her place, Ellie set aside her book and gave her beloved older brother her full attention, just as if he&#x2019;d clamored for it, which he would never do.</p> <p>Lysander&#x2019;s dark eyes shifted toward the casement window that looked out onto the inn-yard below. Ellie stood, crossed the room, and leaned one hand upon the window frame to look out. Through small, diamond-shaped panes separated by wooden muntins, she saw a rainy, muddy yard, the same one they&#x2019;d driven into earlier that day on this ridiculous errand that she&#x2019;d have given anything to skip&#x2014;</p> <p>&#x201c;My goodness!&#x201d; She leaned closer, peering down at a limp form even now being lifted from a dark, unmarked carriage. &#x201c;Is that man dead?&#x201d; She glanced back over her shoulder in time to catch Zander shaking his head. She rose to tiptoes and pressed her forehead to the chilly glass to watch as the burdened men passed directly below her on their way into the inn. When she noted the horizontal gentleman rolling his head in feverish protest, she let out a breath of relief.</p> <p>Then she noticed the other man, still out in the rain, pulling two satchels from the carriage. She wasn&#x2019;t sure why her gaze was pulled to him.</p> <p>The fellow turned at that moment and lifted his gaze to meet hers, almost as if he&#x2019;d known she stood there, watching him. A jolt of something exhilarating shot through her and fixed low in her belly. Elektra caught her breath in surprise, then blinked at her own reaction.</p> <p>Then the stranger lifted one hand to his dripping hat and tipped it, all the while gazing at her boldly. Cheeky fellow!</p> <p>Her eyes narrowed as she cataloged the curious fellow&#x2019;s person. Years of practice taking note of appearances had bestowed a lightning ability to accurately sort and label everyone she met according to wealth and rank.</p> <p>His build was tall and fit, at least as far as she could tell beneath his oilcloth cape. He moved like a man prepared for anything&#x2014;a little like the Worthington siblings&#x2019; old fencing master, combined with the determined intent of a pugilist and a dash of the head-up awareness of a&nbsp;&#x2026; highwayman?</p> <p>His clothing marked him as a servant or driver. She could not make out his face clearly through the wavy glass spattered with raindrops, but he looked road-worn and unshaven, and far too disreputable to be gazing boldly at a lady as if she were a barmaid.</p> <p><i>Do I look like a barmaid?</i></p> <p>Well, wavy glass twisted the light in both directions, didn&#x2019;t it? Likely he wasn&#x2019;t even looking at her.</p> <p>The flutter in her belly told her a different story, but she ignored it.</p> <p>Never mind the driver. What of the first man, the ill one? Tapping her fingertip on her bottom lip, Elektra drew his image from her memory.</p> <p>&#x201c;That was a fine coat,&#x201d; she mused aloud. &#x201c;Though it is from several seasons ago&nbsp;&#x2026; real gold thread, I&#x2019;d say, from the shimmer&nbsp;&#x2026; it fitted a bit loose, but if he&#x2019;s been ill&#x2026;&#x201d; She let her assessing gaze encompass the carriage as the horse boy led the team out of the rain. &#x201c;The carriage is well made, though it is almost as old as the one in our mews. Could be he can&#x2019;t replace it, or could be the frugality of the wealthy, buying good and keeping it up.&#x201d; She squinted as she tried to peer between raindrops at the disappearing horses. &#x201c;His team is matched, but they are too covered in mud to tell if they&#x2019;re fine.&#x201d;</p> <p>She set back on her heels with a sigh, her curiosity wriggling like a hooked fish. &#x201c;I would have liked to have seen his face, but it wouldn&#x2019;t look proper for me to run out and gawk.&#x201d; Though she had taken a good long look at the driver, hadn&#x2019;t she? She turned to Zander. &#x201c;Go on, will you, and tell me if he&#x2019;s dying? And if he&#x2019;s young or old? Ask the innkeeper&#x2014;well, try to catch his name, at any rate.&#x201d;</p> <p>Zander nodded indifferently and left the room.</p> <p>Elektra glanced back through the rain-streaked glass, but the yard had inconveniently been emptied of evidence. The impudent driver was gone as well.</p> <p>With a huff of impatience, she stomped back to her chair and sat with a flounce. She was bored out of her mind, stuck in this room, waiting for a cousin she&#x2019;d never seen&#x2014;never even heard her parents speak of, for pity&#x2019;s sake!&#x2014;the previously unknown Bliss Worthington. They were meeting her halfway from her home in Shropshire, the seat of the Worthington name, where apparently she had long been living with a foster family far from London. Their mission, in the end, was to bring Miss Bliss Worthington to London to share in Elektra&#x2019;s hard-won victorious first Season.</p> <p><i>I, as one might imagine, am less than thrilled at the prospect.</i></p> <p>Not that Elektra was looking forward to the journey back to London, particularly. It had been a slow, dreary ride&#x2014;where she&#x2019;d been mostly alone inside the coach. Lysander rode his horse alongside, since he was still quite unable to be confined in a small space. No one in the family knew what had happened to Lysander in those months when the world had thought him dead behind enemy lines, but the tense stranger who had come home was every bit as beloved as the laughing boy who had gone away soldiering.</p> <p>He was simply not as well understood.</p> <p>The assumption was that Bliss would join her in the coach home. Doubtless she would come supplied with luggage after all.</p> <p>The foul weather that had made Elektra and Lysander&#x2019;s journey a slow and tedious one had apparently delayed Bliss&#x2019;s arrival as well. The only interesting thing to happen in the past tedious hours of waiting was the arrival of a dead man. Well, almost dead.</p> <p>Elektra pondered the possibilities, uncomfortably aware that she was being quite heartless.</p> <p>Well, a girl in her position couldn&#x2019;t afford a heart, could she?</p> <p>Folding her arms, she allowed herself to slouch back into the seat and glare around at her private little domain. If the new gentleman were of any social quality at all, he would likely claim this room for himself, contingent on his survival, of course. The Worthington name was old and well connected, but not terribly high in rank&#x2014;and the innkeeper would doubtless prefer to be paid in something more substantial than Elektra&#x2019;s radiant smile.</p> <p>The only thing more boring than being stuck in this dingy sitting room would be to languish in her own tiny closet of a private room. Even her best smile and a demurely cleavage-focusing curtsy hadn&#x2019;t been able to upgrade her accommodations above what...</p></p><h2>The God Memorandum Gift Edition</h2><p>Mandino is the most widely read inspirational and self-help author in the world and also the author of 18 books with total sales of more than 36 million copies sold in 22 languages.</p><p>Og Mandino is the most widely read inspirational and self help author in the world.

Drawn to rock'n'roll as a rebellion against his suburban London upbringing, Bowie's career has been one of constant reinvention and innovation. As a musician and composer, his influences are wide ranging: he borrows as much from contemporaries such as The Rolling Stones and German synthesizer bands Neu! and Kraftwerk as from composers Kurt Weill and frequent collaborator Brian Eno. He is also heavily influenced by broader culture, notably adopting the cut up method often employed by William Burroughs, while being "strongly influenced" by the video work of Andy Warhol. Beyond music, however, Bowie cultivated a constantly shifting sense of style&#x2014;most famously as his glam rock, alien alter-ego Ziggy Stardust&#x2014;his various costumes were "Dadaist in impulse and Surrealist in conception and execution." Particularly striking, however, was the cobweb body-suit he wore for The 1980 Floor Show, which features two glitter covered mannequin hands that seem to be fondling his chest as a kind of camp provocation. Indeed, as Camille Paglia notes, Bowie came to embody "the shaman and prophet who crossed into forbidden sexual terrain."

Otherness, the simple fact of being different in some way, has come to be defined as in and of itself evil. Miroslav Volf contends that if the healing word of the gospel is to be heard today, Christian theology must find ways of speaking that address the hatred of the other. Is there any hope of embracing our enemies? Of opening the door to reconciliation? Reaching back to the New Testament metaphor of salvation as reconciliation, Volf proposes the idea of embrace as a theological response to the problem of exclusion.<br> <br> Increasingly we see that exclusion has become the primary sin, skewing our perceptions of reality and causing us to react out of fear and anger to all those who are not within our (ever-narrowing) circle. In light of this, Christians must learn that salvation comes, not only as we are reconciled to God, and not only as we "learn to live with one another," but as we take the dangerous and costly step of opening ourselves to the other, of enfolding him or her in the same embrace with which we have been enfolded by God.<br> <br> Volf won the 2002 Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion for the first edition of his book, <em>Exclusion &amp; Embrace: A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation </em>(Abingdon, 1996). In that first edition, professor Volf, a Croatian by birth, analyzed the civil war and &#x201c;ethnic cleansing&#x201d; in the former Yugoslavia, and he readily found other examples of cultural, ethnic, and racial conflict to illustrate his points. Since September 11, 2001, and the subsequent epidemic of terror and massive refugee suffering throughout the world, Volf revised <em>Exclusion and Embrace</em> to account for the evolving dynamics of inter-ethnic and international strife.<br></p><p>Miroslav Volf is the Henry B.

In this alluring new book, Keith Summerour shares nine houses, exploring their architecture, interiors, and grounds, to illustrate a new idea of home. Reinterpreting and making new his own Southern legacy that speaks both of aristocratic charm and homespun appeal, these homes range from rustic retreats that draw their power from the land to elegant manor houses, but all share extraordinary character and charm that nod to history while reflecting the way people wish to live in the world today.<br> &nbsp;<br> Enriched by the work of some of the top interior decorators working today, including Beth Webb, Barbara Westbrook, Circa Interiors, and Liza Bryan, as well as world-renowned landscape designers Jeremy Smearman and John Howard, and beautifully illustrated with all-new photography, <i>Creating Home</i> is the ultimate dream book.</p><p>Architect <b>Keith Summerour, </b>whose work has been featured in <i>Architectural Digest</i>,<i> Garden &amp; Gun</i>, and<i> Coastal Living</i>, was raised in Alabama and trained at Auburn University, and his firm is now based in Atlanta, Georgia, though his projects range from coast to coast. <br><br><b>Andrew and Gemma Ingalls </b>are a husband-and-wife photography team whose clients include <i>Saveur</i> and <i>House Beautiful</i>."Keith Summerour embraces his approach to classical design in his first book, set to be released next month. The Atlanta-based architect takes readers on a tour through some of his projects, from renovations to newly built abodes, that showcase his interpretation of classical style. To round out the volume, Summerour shares photos of his private country residence that he designed in rural Georgia with a 70-foot-high stone tower."<br>&#x2014;<i>EditorAtLarge.com</i>&nbsp;<br><br>"In his new book&nbsp;<i>Creating Home: Design for Living</i>&nbsp;(Rizzoli, $50), Summerour writes of his own country house, 'I have learned to adjust myself to my home's personality, just as I might accept the quirks of a special, appealingly complicated friend.'"<br>&#x2014;<i>Architectural Digest<br><br></i>"An architect whose work is classically rooted, <b>Summerour taps into his Southern heritage, creating houses that are both soulful and respectful of the land on which they sit</b>.

Why are so many people&#x2019;s eyes misaligned? What started as a simple search to understand this phenomenon turned into a two-year quest that uncovered hidden links between our crooked faces and some of the most puzzling diseases of our time.From autism to Alzheimer&#x2019;s and from chronic fatigue syndrome to Crohn&#x2019;s disease, Crooked methodically goes through the most recent scientific research and connects the dots from the outbreak of metallic medicine in 1800s England to the eruption of neurological and autoimmune disorders so many are suffering from today. If the theories put forth in this book are true, the convergence of metals, microbes and medicine that started two hundred years ago may have set humanity on a path of suffering that could make the deadliest epidemics in history pale in comparison. Thankfully, for the millions who are afflicted, who may have found nothing to explain the cause of their suffering &#x2014; these same theories could also illuminate the path to healing and recovery.<br><br><b>WITH CHAPTERS &amp; EXPLANATIONS FOR THESE ILLNESSES</b><ul><li>ADHD</li><li>Allergies</li><li>Anemia</li><li>Asthma</li><li>Autism</li><li>Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease</li><li>Chronic fatigue syndrome</li><li>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)</li><li>Crohn&#x2019;s disease</li><li>Diabetes (Type 1)</li><li>Eating disorders</li><li>Eczema</li><li>Fibromyalgia</li><li>Hearing disorders</li><li>Heart disease</li><li>Lupus</li><li>Lyme disease</li><li>Multiple sclerosis</li><li>PANDAS / PANS</li><li>Parkinson&#x2019;s disease</li><li>POTS</li><li>Rheumatoid arthritis</li><li>Sarcoidosis</li><li>Sensory processing disorder</li><li>Tics</li><li>Tourette syndrome</li><li>Tuberous sclerosis complex</li><li>Ulcerative colitis</li><li>Zika</li></ul></p><p>Forrest Maready was born in Wilmington, N.C and grew up around a large film studio and the many movies and TV shows that filmed there.

When it comes to being a respectful, thoughtful, and responsible consumer of pot, there is a lot you need to know. In <i>Higher Etiquette</i>, Lizzie Post--great-great granddaughter of Emily Post and co-president of America's most respected etiquette brand--explores and celebrates the wide world of legalized weed. Combining cannabis culture's long-established norms with the Emily Post Institute's tried-and-true principles, this book covers the social issues surrounding pot today, such as:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to bring it to a dinner party or give it as a gift<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why eating it is different from inhaling it<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to respectfully use it as a guest<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why different strains affect you in different ways<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to be behave at a dispensary<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to tackle pot faux pas such as "canoed" joints and "lawn-mowed" bowls<br><br>This handy guide also provides a primer on the diverse array of cannabis products and methods of use, illuminating the many convenient and accessible options available to everyone from experienced users to newbies and the canna-curious. Informative, charming, and stylishly illustrated, this buzzworthy book will make the ultimate lit addition to your stash.</p><p>LIZZIE POST is co-president of The Emily Post Institute (EPI). She has been an Emily Post etiquette author and spokesperson for 10 years and a cannabis supporter for 20 years. She cohosts the <i>Awesome Etiquette</i> podcast, and produces both EPI's e-learning program and the <i>Etiquette Bites </i>video series. As a member of the youngest generation of Posts, Lizzie is a popular source of advice on modern manners for Millennials.When I began this project and started telling friends and family the subject matter, I received emphatic encouragement from many. For those who consume cannabis, weed etiquette is real, and it was high time someone wrote a book about it. Others had a harder time understanding the connection between pot and etiquette. To better bridge the gap, I&#x2019;d like to introduce you to Emily Post etiquette and show you how it connects with the world of cannabis culture. Emily Post said, &#x201c;Whenever two people come together and their behavior affects one another, you have etiquette. It is not some rigid code of manners.&#x201d; <br><br>It was this attitude that has made Emily Post North America&#x2019;s go-to source for etiquette advice for the past ninety-five years. With a hit 1930s radio program The Right Thing to Do, a best-selling book Etiquette (now in its nineteenth edition), and an ability to be both relatable and aspirational, Emily Post helped define American manners. Though Emily died in 1960, her practical and kind approach toward social graces has been carried on by her family through the Emily Post Institute. There, my cousin Daniel Post Senning and I are the fifth generation to run the company. Given Emily&#x2019;s definition, it&#x2019;s safe to say that cannabis culture is baked in etiquette, has been for a long time, and goes far beyond puff-puff-pass.<br><br>So what is etiquette? At the Emily Post Institute, we say that etiquette is made up of two things: manners and principles. Manners are fascinating. They are the actions, words, and expectations that we create as a society for interacting with one another. Manners help us to know what is expected from us and what we can expect from others in a given situation. Manners can be good or bad. They are specific to periods of time, and they vary by country, by culture, and even by social group or family. When changes occur in a culture (like the legalization of cannabis), new manners emerge, and others become traditions of the past or obsolete. Principles are reassuring. They are the concepts that can help guide us toward good interactions when there are no specific manners. <br><br>The principles that we believe influence etiquette are consideration, respect, and honesty. When our intentions are based on these principles, even when things go badly, others can understand our good intent. These three principles can be applied to any situation in which you may find yourself. If you think about how the people in a given situation are affected (consideration), acknowledge the potential effects of possible solutions on those involved (respect), and choose to act in a way that genuinely benefits the most people in the situation (honesty), you&#x2019;re likely going to find a solution that will solve the problem at hand as well as honor and build the relationships involved. In short: etiquette is about being aware of all the factors contributing to a situation and how the possible outcomes could impact each of the players. Good etiquette looks for the outcome that positively benefits the most people.</p><h2>Murder in the Bayou: Who Killed the Women Known as the Jeff Davis 8?</h2><p><b><i>New York Times </i>Bestseller<br> A <i>Southern Living</i> Book of the Year</b><br> <br> &#x201c;Part murder case, part corruption expos�, and part Louisiana noir&#x201d; (<i>New York</i> magazine), <i>Murder in the Bayou</i> chronicles the twists and turns of a high-stakes investigation into the murders of eight women in a troubled Louisiana parish.<br><br>Between 2005 and 2009, the bodies of eight women were discovered around the murky canals and crawfish ponds of Jennings, Louisiana, a bayou town of 10,000 in the heart of the Jefferson Davis parish. The women came to be known as the Jeff Davis 8, and local law enforcement officials were quick to pursue a serial killer theory, opening a floodgate of media coverage and stirring a wave of panic across Jennings&#x2019; class-divided neighborhoods. The Jeff Davis 8 had been among society&#x2019;s most vulnerable&#x2014;impoverished, abused, and mired with mental illness. They engaged in sex work as a means of survival. And their underworld activity frequently occurred at a decrepit no-tell motel called the Boudreaux Inn.<br> <br> As the cases went unsolved, the community began to look inward. Rumors of police corruption and evidence tampering, of collusion between street and shield, cast the serial killer theory into doubt. But what was really going on in the humid rooms of the Boudreaux Inn? Why were crimes going unsolved and police officers being indicted? What had the eight women known? And could anything be done do stop the bloodshed?<br> <br> Mixing muckraking research and immersive journalism over the course of a five-year investigation, Ethan Brown reviewed thousands of pages of previously unseen homicide files to posit what happened during each victim&#x2019;s final hours. &#x201c;Brown is a man on a mission...he gives the victims more respectful attention than they probably got in real life&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times</i>). <i>Murder</i> <i>in the Bayou</i> is the story of an American town buckling under the dark forces of poverty, race, and class division&#x2014;and a lightning rod for justice for the daughters it lost. &#x201c;A must-read for true-crime fans&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review).</p><p>Ethan Brown is an investigative journalist, private investigator, and author of four previous books, <i>Murder in the Bayou</i>,&nbsp;<i>Queens Reigns Supreme, Snitch,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Shake the Devil Off</i>, which was named one of the Best Books of 2009 by&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i>.

One of the most honored writers for children, his many awards include the Newbery Medal, three Newbery Honor Medals, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, the May Hill Arbuthnot Honor Lecture Award and a National Humanities Medal.

His illustrations have appeared in The New Yorker as well as in books for children. He lives in England.Gr 3-5-Freedman tackles the Boston Tea Party with his characteristic energy and rigor and provides a gripping account of the nation-defining episode. He starts with a lucid, two-page introduction offering historical context-not stopping to get bogged down in the details of the Stamp Tax and its ilk-before he vaults into his story with a promising opening that mixes fact and suspense. From that page forward, he weaves together meticulously sourced quotations and information with engaging personal details to effectively enliven the tense, silent act of rebellion. Along with the usual heroes of the Revolution-Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, etc.-Freedman presents the actions of young men such as a rope-maker's apprentice who snuck out a window to join the mob and the mason-in-training who detoured to the protest on his way to a date. These charming and enlightening particulars, including many direct quotes, lend immediacy and emotional weight to the account, told in an effective but surprisingly casual tone. Freedman's absorbing and informative story is somewhat underserved by Malone's illustrations. A rich, earthy palette and period details, even with an occasional spark of humor, can't quite overcome the static feeling of the pictures, which resemble watercolor renditions of an American history diorama with their stiff-armed figures and blank faces. Fortunately, Freedman's text proves lively enough for both. Back matter includes a note on the importance of tea in colonial American life.-Robbin E.

Considered a prodigy in scientific research, he surprised everyone and himself by setting his sights on the competitive world of high finance. Yet no sooner had he landed an entry-level position at a prestigious firm than Gardner found himself caught in a web of incredibly challenging circumstances that left him as part of the city's working homeless and with a toddler son. Motivated by the promise he made to himself as a fatherless child to never abandon his own children, the two spent almost a year moving among shelters, "HO-tels," soup lines, and even sleeping in the public restroom of a subway station. </p><p>Never giving in to despair, Gardner made an astonishing transformation from being part of the city's invisible poor to being a powerful player in its financial district. </p><p>More than a memoir of Gardner's financial success, this is the story of a man who breaks his own family's cycle of men abandoning their children.

She has written about living with cerebral palsy in <i>Teen Vogue</i>, <i>Essence</i>, <i>Catapult</i>, <i>Glamour</i>, <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</i>, and other publications. She holds a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in journalism from the State University of New York at Fredonia and she has a love for popular culture and cheesecake. She lives in New York with her family.The Pretty One INTRODUCTION<p></p> <br>Hey, friends! My name is Keah and I&#x2019;m cute as hell. I love popular culture, music, cheesecake, cheeseburgers, and pizza. I dance in cars with my friends and again at their weddings. We sing songs down store aisles and play cards for hours. I live-tweet TV shows and laugh at my own jokes. I text my friend Danielle Sepulveres about Christmas movies and watch the Hallmark Channel for hours. When I am alone, I thoroughly enjoy playing The Sims. I am obsessed with lipsticks and I am trying and failing to learn the art of applying eye shadow. (I hope that you read all of that in the same vein as the intro to the Nickelodeon show The Wild Thornberrys, because that was my intent, though I don&#x2019;t think it lines up quite as nicely as I would have liked it to.)<br> <br>My point is that I do all these things in a disabled body, not because I am brave or bold, but because I like doing them and I would love doing them in any body. I adapt to the world because I have to do so in order to live. My disability is cerebral palsy, and it affects the right side of my body, effectively altering my motor skills and reaction time as well as the strength of my bones on that side. I don&#x2019;t do things in spite of anything&#x2014;except for maybe the people who told me I&#x2019;d be nothing and no one. I don&#x2019;t mind being an inspiration if it is for a valid reason, such as admiring how many slices of pizza I ate, an essay or an article I wrote, my clothing choices, or how quickly I can learn the lyrics to songs. As long as the inspiration doesn&#x2019;t come with pity or self-congratulatory pats on the back, I am all for it. Let my love for cheesecake inspire you the way it will one day inspire a nation. At least you can say you were there first.<br> <br>Before I hop on a soapbox, let me stop and share some fun but key facts about myself. Let&#x2019;s start with music: Paramore and Demi Lovato are my favorite musicians, and music has been a huge part of my journey so far. I tell myself that my love for TV is balanced only by my love for books, so it&#x2019;s fitting that I became a writer, in order to write about TV and fight for proper representation in media for people who look like me, and a journalist, in order to talk to musicians, writers, and actors. I love doing both, so don&#x2019;t even bother asking me to choose. I like getting lost in other people&#x2019;s worlds for a while&#x2014;it takes the pressure off having to answer for my disabled body and sit in the contempt that some people have for it&#x2014;and I like talking to people and figuring out how and why they became who they became. I hate winter even though I live in western New York, where it snows so much that it has felt like a personal attack on my life, for all my life.<br> <br>Apart from the weather where I live, my life experience is far exceeding my expectations. I never thought anyone would want to hear what I had to say until I started telling stories and talking about the things and people that matter to me. The truth is this: I&#x2019;ve always felt average, plain, and wrong, but there is nothing average, plain, or wrong about me, and it took me only half my life so far to figure that out. I wrote an entire book and you are gearing up to read it. How cool is that? So cool.<br> <br>Sometimes, it is beautiful to prove yourself wrong.<br> <br>A thing that happens when you&#x2019;re tasked with writing a book is that you start to learn new things about yourself while you write to contend with your past. Who I am at present is a person who loudly and proudly gives a damn about herself, other people, and the world at large. Caring is fun, and I find that it has made me both happier and healthier, though I wish that I could care less about the opinions of naysayers. Rome wasn&#x2019;t built in a day and all that, so I&#x2019;m guessing there is still time to change and reach my final form. When writing this book, I had to remind myself that who I had been in the past is important, too, and I try my hardest to remember that, instead of hiding her away out of embarrassment. In any case, I am unable to go back in time and tell her what I think she knows now. If I did that, though, who knows if any of this would still be possible? I won&#x2019;t let wishful time travel get in the way of my experience.<br> <br>There is still so much left to learn. One of the biggest things that I am discovering is that I should learn to sit in my joy longer and not immediately apologize for being proud and happy. My happiness and joy are still relatively new because I started embracing them only four years ago, and while they are still growing, changing, and taking form in new and exciting ways, where I am now and where I am going are possible only because of where I was.<br> <br>What I can see now is that I was always cute. I look at old pictures and see a girl whose smile was wide and face was full but who didn&#x2019;t see her beauty. I smiled widely for a girl who didn&#x2019;t like waking up and seeing herself, because she didn&#x2019;t want anyone else to know the truth, which she let out only when she was alone. It is my belief that sometimes we keep secrets and hide our deepest insecurities because we believe that if other people found them out they would agree and believe them to be true, too. At least, this was why I tried my hardest not to let on how depressed and angry I was. (But I&#x2019;m certain now that I wasn&#x2019;t as good at hiding my feelings as I thought I was.)<br> <br>At the time, I didn&#x2019;t recognize that I was feeding into the narrative of shame and disability that society had created: that Keah saw someone so broken that she could never be whole again. Yes, my insecurities were self-made, but they had been encouraged and influenced by a society that had taught me early on that I was not supposed to feel beautiful in a body like mine. I was supposed to hate it until the day I died. The minute I stopped listening to that kind of thinking was the minute I started living.<br> <br>I am a twenty-six-year-old black woman with a physical disability who is much more than her disability. However, I understand that the erasure of disability in our society is just as harmful as the negative portrayals of disability throughout our society. For a really long time I believed that ignoring my disability and tucking it into the deepest parts of myself would make it go away. But that isn&#x2019;t the way the world works, and that is no way to live. My disability is not a thing to see past but instead a thing to acknowledge and accept before able-bodied people and I continue existing at the same time in this world. I have both physical and invisible disabilities, and I refuse to be ashamed of them, because they are beautiful in their uniqueness and their familiarity. They are mine, but they also belong to a world of others, and that makes them worthy of my appreciation and acceptance.<br> <br>When I sat down to write this collection, I decided that honesty would be the basis of the essays you will read. Honesty in the face of sadness, imperfection, anger, grief, and joy. Now that I have joy, I never want to let it go. I want to smother it like a middle-aged mother who is sending her son off to college or a father who lingers at the door after his child has left for her very first date&#x2014;until his wife softly pats him on the arm before pulling him away. (I watch a lot of Hallmark movies, as I said, where these things happen, so just go with it.) I find that in order for me to be the best version of myself, these stories have to be told, because I need to forgive myself for who I was in order to become who I am becoming. The saying goes that no idea is original but that the people who share the idea and stories are&#x2014;that has to count for something, right? Black disabled women aren&#x2019;t the ones you see on store bookshelves; we aren&#x2019;t the ones you catch at literary events and on bestseller lists. I want to change that, and the best way I know how is through the written word. I write to feel seen and heard. I write so that I cannot be ignored. My words are my announcement that I am here&#x2014;and that I am not going anywhere.<br> <br>These stories must live on in printed pages so that I can keep the people in them forever, so that when I am gone no one will be able to say that Keah Brown did not choose to live a life she was proud of. I am a black woman with cerebral palsy who loves herself now, and most days that feels like a revolutionary act. It took a lot of work to get to this place, a fountain of tears, grief, and loss, but I&#x2019;m here, and it is beautiful.<br> <br>I think in order to get where we are going I&#x2019;ve got some bases to cover. When this book is first released into the world, I will be twenty-seven, and that&#x2019;s a big deal to me. First, because I am terrible at math and my twin sister had to tell me that we would not be twenty-eight when these words are first read. (This was bittersweet news, because a thing to know about me is that even numbers are my jam. They&#x2019;ve been so good to me. Some of the most monumental things that have happened to me involved even numbers. I went to San Diego Comic-Con in 2014 with my friends and saw Paramore and Fall Out Boy in concert, and in 2016 I learned to love my body and the person in it. A year later, when I was twenty-six, I went viral after creating #DisabledAndCute, a hashtag that began as a celebration of that newfound love, and then I landed an agent and a book deal in the same year. I&#x2019;m flexing a little, but these are the best examples I have.) Who knows where I will be when both you and I read these words bound in book form? But wherever I am, know that I am grateful and excited to share these stories of my life and the world around me with you.<br> <br>The real star here, though, is #DisabledAndCute, my firstborn child. I had her on February 12, 2017, at 12:48 p.m. She weighed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I won&#x2019;t do that to you. You know how parents say they don&#x2019;t have a favorite child and that they love all their children equally? I believe it, but I also believe that there&#x2019;s special care and attention that comes with the first. My hashtag means the world to me and this book does, too, so I try hard to give them equal love and attention. I think it&#x2019;s working. At least when it comes to the hashtag and the book. In my human family, I refer to myself as the second firstborn, and I believe I am my mother&#x2019;s favorite&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s another story. We should get back to the hashtag before my brother and sister learn the truth.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t create my hashtag in the hopes that it would go viral and change my life, but that&#x2019;s exactly what happened. A celebration of myself became a place of community in which people from all walks of life began celebrating themselves and each other. The hashtag has given me the opportunity to speak in places like Portland, Oregon, and Greencastle, Indiana, about ethics, representation, and my hopes for the future. The hashtag has given me a place to belong and a thing to hold on to during the rough days while also helping me build an audience to get my other work in front of willing eyes and ears.<br> <br>I dream of a life in which someone loves me romantically and in which I can attend my ten-year high school reunion with enough success to make everyone who doubted me jealous. (This is an admittedly silly dream that would feel a bit like the reunion in Romy and Michele&#x2019;s High School Reunion, except I wouldn&#x2019;t be lying about the Post-its but would absolutely keep the ending dance number.) Yet remember what I said about honesty. I did also dream of writing this book, and I did it, so literally anything and everything else feels possible now. The lesson I am learning in this life is that people give a damn much more than we might think possible.<br> <br>Right now, I live in a city famous only for its locks along the Erie Canal. I live here with my mother, Cheryl; my twin sister, Leah; and my brother, Eric; as well as my aunts, cousins, and uncles. I live here while I dream of living in Los Angeles and calling the sunny locale my home. Before I turn that dream into reality, I spend too much time in Walmart, TJ Maxx, and Rue 21 for anyone&#x2019;s comfort. I attend sporadic game nights at my friend Demetrius&#x2019;s house. And I buy clothes online when I am having a bad day and need a pick-me-up. I live in a place of comfort that is all I have ever known, but I am ready to leave it for new adventures, knowing that I&#x2019;ll always have the people to come back to even when the home is no longer where it was.<br> <br>My writing practices are routine. I write and interview people while sitting on my bed. I watch TV there, too, and I fall in love with fictional characters and make up scenarios to keep myself from feeling unlovable. I have a character or characters whom I love for every day of the week, depending on the show I&#x2019;m watching that day. I love these characters&#x2014;some romantically and some like you might love a puppy or a small child. In my real life, though, there is a bit of irony in knowing that I love myself even though someone else hasn&#x2019;t yet chosen to. The kind of love that I want now is of the romantic variety. I have more love from my friends and family than I have deserved sometimes. We don&#x2019;t have perfect relationships, of course; we still fight and yell and hurt each other the way you do as human beings, but the love is loud and unchanging. My friends and family loved me first, before any success I have had, before any partnerships with clothing companies or TV spots, and before I loved or liked myself. In many ways, this collection of essays is a love letter to them and how their love and support got me to this place.<br> <br>I spend a lot of time thinking about the idea and practice of places. There are the inaccessible places with broken railings and elevators. There are the comfortable and beautiful places that feel like home and possibility. And there are the places that fall somewhere in between, that are neither good nor bad but exist just the same, like the Medium Place on NBC&#x2019;s The Good Place. That is the magic of place: it can be anything and everything all at once. I said in a poem once that I often think of my body as a place and not a thing. But my body became a place, a home, only when I started loving it. Before love, my body was a thing, a cage holding me hostage and keeping me when I desperately wanted to be elsewhere. Before love, my body was a thing to pity and hate, a thing for other people to look at and feel grateful wasn&#x2019;t theirs.<br> <br>The world, in many ways, still sees me and my body this way. Disabled bodies are often used to make the able-bodied feel better about their own bodies; we are a reminder that &#x201c;it could be worse.&#x201d; I fight anyway for all people to live their best lives, except Nazis, racists, transphobes, homophobes, and the like. I don&#x2019;t care how they feel. I hope they have the worst days and karma does what it has to do when the time comes.<br> <br>I refuse to be a reminder of someone&#x2019;s worst-case scenario again. If you need me to be a reminder, I will be your reminder that things will get better. I will be a reminder that people like me exist and thrive and that we aren&#x2019;t going anywhere. Long gone are the days of silence and complacency. I will see and be seen, and I no longer care about the comfort of those who would rather I be quiet or wait my turn for proper and positive representation in our culture and mainstream media. Disabled people are at once invisible and a burden. In the rare event that Hollywood decides to depict us, we are seen only as white male wheelchair users who hate themselves. There is nothing inherently wrong about telling the stories of the white and male wheelchair users&#x2014;their storie...</p><h2>Thirty Steps to Heaven</h2><p>Many laypeople have attempted to read the great spiritual classic, The Ladder of Divine Ascent, but have been frustrated in attempting to apply the lessons of this monastic text to their everyday lives in the world.

It provides fascinatingly fresh insights into Beatle history, exploding myths and uncovering dozens of new stories along the way. John, Paul, George, and Ringo's moves from cheap early instruments to the pick of 1960s technology are carefully and entertainingly documented in an easy-to-read narrative, fully illustrated with many previously unseen photographs, a cache of rare memorabilia, and a unique collection of specially photographed instruments used by the Beatles.<br><br>As we continue to find new ways to explore their sound, from vivid remasters of their original recordings to cutting-edge video games, the Beatles remain at the forefront of popular music. This landmark book is perfect for the fan absorbed by music rather than hairstyles, for the tribute-band member with an eye for detail, and for any reader with an abiding interest in the 1960s. With a foreword by acclaimed Beatle author Mark Lewisohn, <i>Beatles Gear</i> tells it like it was.</p><p><b>Andy Babiuk</b> (Rochester, NY) is a musician, writer, producer, and founding member of the Chesterfield Kings. He has been a professional in the music industry for more than 30 years and is the owner of the boutique music shop Andy Babiuk's Fab Gear. He is currently in the band the Empty Hearts, featuring Elliot Easton from the Cars on lead guitar, Clem Burke from Blondie on drums, and Wally Palmar from the Romantics on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. <i>The Empty Hearts</i> LP was released worldwide on 429/Universal Records in August 2014.''Gear heads, rejoice: Beatles instrument expert Babiuk returns with an expanded edition of his acclaimed reference book. In addition to the original material, the author has added over 650 new photos and more stories behind the group's iconic guitars, drums, pianos, amps, and more.'' --Something Else Reviews<br><br>''The original Beatles Gear book was published back in 2001 and, over the past decade-and-a-half, it's become the go-to bible for anyone with an interest in the extensive equipment the Fab Four dabbled with during their incredible albeit brief career.<br>The new expanded Ultimate Edition, which has recently hit the shops, provides fascinating new interviews, 650 new and previously unpublished photos and a slew of surprising recent gear-related discoveries that author Andy Babiuk has helped uncover.'' --Music Radar<br><br>''For devoted fans, gear collectors, and anyone else with a hankering for Fab Four gear knowledge, it doesn't get much better than this.'' - Guitar Aficionado<br><br> ''Babiuk has rightly become the go-to guy for Beatle instrument authentication; such is his extraordinary expertise in the subject. But what's most pleasing about Beatles Gear is that it isn't geeky in the least (though geeks are well catered for!), presented as a highly readable book, rammed with nuggets, anecdotes and insight, as well as mountains of great photos, including a strip of snaps from the least-well-trodden of Beatle tales the making of Abbey Road and little stories such as when driver Alf Bicknell had to break it to George Harrison that his prized Gretsch had fallen off the back of their car and under a lorry. The only mystery is why they didn't call it Fab Gear.'' - Record Collector Magazine<br><br> ''With huge photos and great gear shots, the engagingly written Beatles Gear Ultimate Edition is equally likely to appeal to Beatles fans, gear hounds, engineers, and those interested in world history and how it shapes pop culture. Beatles Gear is massive, with thick paper stock, glossy pages, and a sturdy cover. It's obvious that a tremendous amount of research went into this, and it couldn't have been done without contributions and input from people within the Beatles' organization. Informative and entertaining, and with a impressive amount of photos of rare instruments (including shots of the actual instruments used by the band, many of which have never been published before), it's a visual delight as well. Whether you read it cover to cover, browse through the various chapters randomly, or use it as a research tool, it's bound to entertain, elucidate, and delight. It really is the definitive volume on all the gear used by four young chaps from the UK who happened to change the world forever.'' --Harmony Central</p><h2>�Un tipo grande se llev� mi pelota!-An Elephant and Piggie Book, Spanish Edition</h2><p>Gerald is careful.

Suspicious of others and insecure about ourselves, we retreat into the safety of our small, self-made worlds. Now more than ever, it&#x2019;s easy to avoid people with whom we disagree or whose life experiences don&#x2019;t mirror our own. Safe among like-minded peers and digital &#x201c;friends,&#x201d; we really don&#x2019;t have to engage with those who can challenge and enhance our limited perspectives. Tragically, even the church can become a place that minimizes diversity and reinforces isolation.<br><br>Jesus models a much richer vision of friendship. Scott Sauls, pastor and teacher, invites you to see the breadth of Christ&#x2019;s love in this book, <i>BeFriend.</i> Join Scott on this journey through twenty-one meditations to inspire actively pursuing God&#x2019;s love through expanding your circle of friends.<br><br>Scott has met too many people whose first impulse is to fence off their lives with relational barriers that only end up starving their own souls.<br><br>Yes, it&#x2019;s true: Real friendship is costly. Love does make us vulnerable. But without risk, our lives will remain impoverished.<br><br>Join Scott in <i>BeFriend</i> as he summons you toward diverse friendship that can enrich your life and, in the process, reveal a better version of yourself.</p><p>Scott Sauls is senior pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church in Nashville, Tennessee and author of <i>Jesus Outside the Lines</i>&nbsp;and <i>Befriend</i>.

He also blogs regularly at scottsauls.com.Sauls (<i>Jesus Outside the Lines</i>), senior pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church in Nashville, Tenn., writes eloquently on the topic of befriending. He covers his bases thoroughly when challenging Christ followers to be proactive about their relationships in these 21 candid chapters. His message is tailored to inspire engagement with new people&#x2015;both inside and outside the church&#x2015;with courage and compassion, reminding Christians that it is all too easy to engage in digital, transactional, one-dimensional friendships when Jesus demands Christians move toward people with intent and self-sacrifice. Befriending, according to Sauls, is the kind of action that may include some initial friction, some hard surfaces, but over time these differences can result in richer, deeper relationships. Readers will learn how to practically seek new relationships with bullies, children, the dying, family members, and strangers. Each chapter is overflowing with compelling true accounts, biblical commentaries, and brief summaries to tie the overarching points together. <b>This is a must read for those stuck in the world of digital-first relationships who seek to enrich their lives and the lives of those they come into contact with daily</b>.

After years of working to help sufferers of panic and anxiety, licensed therapist (and pilot) Tom Bunn discovered a highly effective solution that utilizes a part of the brain not affected by the stress hormones that bombard a person experiencing panic. This &#x201c;unconscious procedural memory&#x201d; can be programmed to control panic by preventing the release of stress hormones and activating the parasympathetic nervous system. This process, outlined in <em>Panic Free</em>, sounds complicated but is not, requiring just ten days and no drugs or doctors. Bunn includes specific instructions for dealing with common panic triggers, such as airplane travel, bridges, MRIs, and tunnels. Because panic is profoundly life-limiting, the program Bunn offers can be a real life-changer.</p><p><strong>Captain Tom Bunn, MSW, LCSW,</strong> is a leading authority on panic disorder, the founder of SOAR Inc., which provides treatment for in-flight panic sufferers, and the author of <em>SOAR: The Breakthrough Treatment for Fear of Flying.</em> He lives in Connecticut.&#x201c;Allows everyone to embrace their full potential with specific, focused, clearly explained, and practical steps to break free from panic attacks.

It offers a challenging alternative, beyond theism and atheism, with a joyful approach to our lives and a caring concern for all life on this earth. Pantheism is a 2,500 year-old belief system expressed by many famous thinkers and artists including Lao Tzu, Heraclitus, Spinoza, Wordsworth, Whitman, Emerson, Einstein and Carl Sagan.Today pantheism is seeing a revival as the underlying world view of many environmentalists, of leading scientists, of nature-revering pagans, and of non-theists looking for a more embracing perspective. This accessible and authoritative handbook is the only available introduction to the history, theory and practice of pantheism.Reviews from Amazon Probably the best book to recommend to someone who is no longer comfortable living with the intellectual compromises necessary to maintain a traditional &#34;faith.&#34; This book is a gem, with useful contextual information and insights on every page. George FaulkneronMust read. Wonderful book for exploring a way to approach religion in a scientific world. Brady Walker This book is the perfect introduction to Pantheism. It&#39;s well written and to the point. Tells what Pantheism is and what it isn&#39;t, offers a history and gives basic practices. Fantastic! Tag JonesThis book is surely one of the most extraordinary books written in recent years about the subject of religion. Dr Bill BruehlHighly impressed with this book and author.

She has lived in the South her entire life.<p><b>Prologue</b></p><p><br>It isn&#x2019;t the rumbling of the trucks that seizes Manfred Bernardo&#x2019;s attention; it is the silence that falls when their ignitions die. Big trucks often go through Midnight, slowing to stop for (or speeding up to beat) the traffic light at the intersection of the Davy highway and Witch Light Road. Since Manfred&#x2019;s rented house lies on Witch Light Road, he&#x2019;s grown used to the sound until it is simply background music. But the absence of that sound pierces his preoccupation. He&#x2019;s on his feet and opening the front door before he&#x2019;s aware of pushing back from his desk. He grabs a jacket from the rack by the door.</p><p>Glancing across the road, he sees his friend Fiji Cavanaugh come out into her front garden, which is at its bleakest in January. It&#x2019;s cold today, by Texas standards, but sunny. Her cat, Mr. Snuggly, a golden tabby, is at his current favorite sunning spot, the base of the pot where Fiji plans to try a gardenia. Even Mr. Snuggly is staring west.</p><p>Manfred exchanges a nod with Fiji, who is bundled in a quilted coat. He notes that today she has inexplicably arranged her hair in two dog-ears, like a six-year-old. Then he turns his attention back to the trucks. One is an equipment truck, and it&#x2019;s laden with building supplies: boards, bricks, electrician&#x2019;s wire, plumbing pipes, hardware. Two battered white vans have disgorged a clown-car number of small brown men, wearing hoodies they will surely discard as the day warms. Emerging from a Lexus, clearly in charge, is a tall white woman in tan slacks and a blue silk T-shirt. She&#x2019;s wearing a faux-fur vest. Her thick brown hair is gathered back into a sleek ponytail, and she wears silver earrings and a silver necklace. She also wears glasses, with big square tortoiseshell frames, and her lipstick is an aggressive red.</p><p>All these various vehicles, with all their assortment of passengers, have converged around the defunct Roca Fr�a Hotel at the southwest corner of the intersection. As far as Manfred knows, it has been closed for decades. The work crews immediately start pulling the boards off the doors and windows and tossing the ancient plywood into a large skip that yet another truck has deposited on the cracked sidewalk. The workmen swarm into the dark interior of the hotel.</p><p>It reminds Manfred of a giant boot kicking a dormant anthill.</p><p>Within five minutes, Fiji has crossed the road to join him. Simultaneously, Bobo Winthrop saunters down the steps of his business and residence, Midnight Pawn, which is situated at the same intersection as the Roca Fria Hotel, but catty-cornered to it. Manfred sees (with resignation) that Bobo is looking quietly handsome today, though he&#x2019;s wearing faded jeans and an ancient T-shirt with an equally ancient flannel shirt open over it. Manfred and Fiji stand with Bobo, and as they do, Manfred sees that west of the intersection, Teacher Reed has come out of Gas N Go; it&#x2019;s directly across the highway from the pawnshop on the east and the hotel on the south. His statuesque wife, Madonna, is standing on the sidewalk in front of the Home Cookin Restaurant with Grady, the baby, who&#x2019;s wrapped in a blanket. She&#x2019;s holding Grady with one arm, shading her eyes with the other. Across the street from Madonna, Joe Strong and Chuy Villegas have stepped out of the Antique Gallery and Nail Salon. Joe is like his name; muscular. He looks as though he may be forty. Chuy is shorter, his dark hair is thinning a bit, and his skin is the color of toast.</p><p>Even the Rev, in his rusty black suit, emerges from his white-painted chapel to cast an unreadable look at all the activity.</p><p>We&#x2019;re only missing Olivia and Lemuel, Manfred thinks. Of course, Lemuel cannot come out during the day, and Olivia is gone on one of her mysterious business trips.</p><p>After a few more minutes of watching and wondering, Joe Strong takes the initiative and strolls across Witch Light Road. He threads his way through the busy men to Boss Woman, who appears to be looking over some plans on a clipboard&#x2014;though Manfred is sure, reading the clues in her stance, that she is well aware of Joe&#x2019;s approach.</p><p>Boss Woman turns to face Joe and extends her free hand to shake his, a professional smile pasted on her face. She is able to look Joe directly in the eyes, Manfred observes. She seems to like what she sees. The well-groomed Joe is pleasant looking and has a warm manner. His mouth moves; her mouth moves. They grin at each other without sincerity. Manfred thinks, It&#x2019;s like watching a ritual. In his peripheral vision, he spies the Rev retreating into his chapel, but the rest of the Midnighters stay outside.</p><p>Bobo turns to Manfred. &#x201c;Had you heard anything about this?&#x201d; he asks.</p><p>&#x201c;No. Believe me, I would have spread the word,&#x201d; Manfred tells his landlord. &#x201c;This is a big thing, right?&#x201d; He is aware that he feels ridiculously excited by this development in the small town where he&#x2019;s lived for less than a year. Rein it in, he advises himself. It&#x2019;s not like the circus has come to town.</p><p>And yet, in a way, it&#x2019;s exactly like that. Fiji&#x2019;s round, pretty face reflects his curiosity. Her eyes are lit up.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; she says, bouncing up and down on the balls of her feet. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to reopen the hotel, huh? How can they even get it back up to code? It&#x2019;s been closed so many years. Everything will need to be ripped out and replaced. Plumbing, electricity . . . floors . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Bobo nods. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been in there. Right after I moved here, Lem and I went in one night. There was a loose board at the back, and Lem pried it open. We had flashlights. He just wanted to show it to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was it like?&#x201d; Manfred asks.</p><p>&#x201c;Spooky as hell. The old reception desk with all the pigeonholes for mail is still there. The light fixtures were just hanging down with all these cobwebs on &#x2019;em. Like a horror movie. High ceilings. Wallpaper coming off in shreds. Smelled like mice. We didn&#x2019;t even go to the second floor. The stairs were a death trap.&#x201d; He smiles. &#x201c;Lem remembered it when it was open. He said it was pretty nice then.&#x201d;</p><p>Lemuel is well over a century and a half old, so it is not surprising that he can remember the hotel in its heyday.</p><p>&#x201c;So why would anyone spend the money to renovate it?&#x201d; Manfred says out loud, since that is the question on all their minds. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be cheaper to build a Motel 6 if you felt like Midnight could support a hotel?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who wants to spend the night here?&#x201d; Fiji asks, another question they&#x2019;ve all thought about. &#x201c;There are three motels in Davy if you go north, and at least six over in Marthasville if you go west. If you go to the interstate, there are a skadillion places to stay. Besides, Home Cookin isn&#x2019;t open for breakfast.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the only restaurant within fifteen miles.</p><p>They contemplate all those facts in silence.</p><p>&#x201c;How many rooms in that hotel?&#x201d; Manfred asks Bobo.</p><p>Bobo looks down at him, blue eyes narrowed in thought. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t think more than twelve,&#x201d; he concludes. &#x201c;The ground floor is the lobby and the kitchen and the dining room, plus there was an ancient phone booth, don&#x2019;t know when that went in . . . and there weren&#x2019;t bathrooms in the rooms . . . so, say four guest rooms on the ground floor plus a bathroom and the public rooms, and then eight on the second floor plus two bathrooms? And the third floor was storage, and staff rooms, Lem said.&#x201d;</p><p>Fiji grabs Bobo&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;You said dining room?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Bobo says, surprised by her agitation. &#x201c;Oh. I get it. The Reeds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how Home Cookin keeps open, anyway. Really. Think about it. How?&#x201d; Manfred spreads his open hands as he asks them.</p><p>But Bobo and Fiji ignore Manfred&#x2019;s question. They are just glad to have a good cook like Madonna in Midnight.</p><p>&#x201c;If they don&#x2019;t open the dining room . . .&#x201d; Bobo says.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be a good thing.&#x201d; Fiji ends his thought. &#x201c;Home Cookin will be busy, Gas N Go will be busy, and maybe even Joe and Chuy will sell more antiques and do more nails.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Huh,&#x201d; Manfred says. &#x201c;That would be all right.&#x201d; Though he really feels he doesn&#x2019;t want anything to change in Midnight, he makes himself admit that a touch of prosperity would be good for the town. His own business is done by telephone and Internet and does not depend on foot traffic.</p><p>Manfred&#x2019;s cell phone rings, and Manfred whips it out of his pocket. He doesn&#x2019;t have to look at the caller ID to know it&#x2019;s Joe, whom he&#x2019;s watched walking back to Chuy.</p><p>&#x201c;We need to have a meeting tonight,&#x201d; Joe says without preamble. &#x201c;Maybe Fiji can go ask the Rev, and Bobo can tell Lemuel. Is Olivia in town?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. What time?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here at the shop, whenever it&#x2019;s really dark.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s a muffled sound while Joe asks Chuy a question. &#x201c;Seven o&#x2019;clock good?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, I&#x2019;ll tell them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See you then.&#x201d;</p><p>Manfred ends the conversation and passes along the message.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell the Rev, but you can&#x2019;t ever predict what he&#x2019;ll do,&#x201d; Fiji says with a shrug.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put a note downstairs for Lemuel,&#x201d; Bobo says. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll see it the minute he gets up. Maybe Olivia will be back by then.&#x201d;</p><p>That night, when the work crews have gone and the tall woman, too, the inhabitants of Midnight assemble in the Antique Gallery and Nail Salon. Occasionally, they can hear Rasta yapping upstairs in the very nice apartment Joe and Chuy share. &#x201c;I thought he might wake up Grady,&#x201d; Chuy explains. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll calm down in a second.&#x201d;</p><p>Sure enough, Rasta falls silent after everyone has filtered in. The salon area is the front right corner of the store, and the antiques, dusted and arranged attractively, take up the rest. Joe has assembled some folding chairs and an old love seat around a refreshments table. He and Chuy have made lemonade and tea, and there are a couple of bottles of wine. They&#x2019;ve put out a cheese and cracker tray. Fiji has brought a bowl of toasted, salted pecans. Manfred tries one to be polite, then finds it hard to resist grabbing a handful.</p><p>When they all have drinks and food, they choose seats.</p><p>Madonna and Teacher settle on the love seat, with baby Grady drowsing on Madonna&#x2019;s chest. Madonna is regal and a little scary, and she&#x2019;s never been especially friendly. Her husband, Teacher, who is running Gas N Go until another buyer is in place, is the town handyman. Teacher is good at everything. Since he&#x2019;s been working at the convenience store full time, projects are going undone in the town, and everyone is ready for a return to the status quo, including Teacher. Grady has started pulling up and will begin walking, and Madonna&#x2019;s already worried about cooking at the restaurant with him staggering around.</p><p>Joe stands in front of the motley assortment of chairs on which they&#x2019;ve perched and begins, &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s what I know.&#x201d;</p><p>They all fall silent and look attentive.</p><p>&#x201c;The woman in charge is Eva Culhane. She&#x2019;s not the owner. She&#x2019;s his or her agent. I don&#x2019;t know who the real owner is, she was real closemouthed about that. Here&#x2019;s what she told me. The hotel is going to reopen as a hotel. But the eight small rooms on the bottom floor will be made into four suites with their own bathrooms, and four rooms on the upper floor will get the same treatment. These will be residence rooms.&#x201d;</p><p>There is an intake of breath because so many people have questions.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Joe says. &#x201c;Wait!&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a little laughter, but they are all too curious or anxious to be very amused.</p><p>&#x201c;The residence rooms will be for people who are in the area for a long-term job, like working for three months at Magic Portal. Or people who are waiting to get in to an elder care situation. As an aside, Eva Culhane told me that there&#x2019;s a waiting list for all the elder care places in a sixty-mile radius. The remaining rooms will be conventional hotel rooms. In the family quarters, there&#x2019;ll be two people living there as staff. A cook will provide breakfast for residents and whoever stays at the hotel. Lunch and dinner will be cooked for permanent residents only, is what I got out of it.&#x201d;</p><p>Madonna&#x2019;s shoulders relax visibly. She gets a few diners from Magic Portal, which is an Internet company, every month. (Thanks to Magic Portal, Midnight has great Internet.) And ranchers come into Midnight every now and then for a meal. But she&#x2019;s in the room with her regulars, right now. More customers would be welcome. Elderly people like traditional food, which is what Madonna cooks.</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of staff?&#x201d; Fiji asks.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be two people in residence,&#x201d; Joe repeats.</p><p>&#x201c;Will one of them be a nurse or some kind of medical person?&#x201d; Bobo asks. &#x201c;Sounds like they might need that. And they&#x2019;ll have to hire a maid, I would think. That&#x2019;s a lot of rooms to clean for one person, plus dishes, plus food prep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good questions. We&#x2019;ll have to find out.&#x201d; Joe looks a little chagrined he didn&#x2019;t think of all this.</p><p>&#x201c;Did Ms. Culhane give you a timetable?&#x201d; Fiji asks.</p><p>&#x201c;She said they hope to be open within six months.&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a moment of silence.</p><p>&#x201c;They must have a shitload of money,&#x201d; Teacher Reed says, and Bobo nods. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a quick turnaround,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>Olivia, who&#x2019;s driven in an hour earlier, speaks for the first time. She is sitting with Lemuel the vampire, her lover, and she looks exhausted. They are all ignoring the fact that Olivia&#x2019;s shoulder is obviously bandaged under her shirt. &#x201c;We have to find out who owns the company doing the restoration,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>&#x201c;Manfred, can you dig that up?&#x201d; Joe asks.</p><p>Manfred is the most computer savvy of all the Midnight residents, but he&#x2019;s no hacker. He just knows his way around the Internet. &#x201c;I can try,&#x201d; he says. Joe hands him a brochure, one that Eva Culhane had given him. It has a corporation name on it, MultiTier Living. Olivia extends her hand silently, and Manfred hands it to her. She looks at the brochure intently before she hands it back.</p><p>When everyone has said everything they had to say (some more than once), Lemuel supports Olivia with his arm as they leave Joe and Chuy&#x2019;s store/salon. The remaining Midnight residents go their separate ways: Teacher, Madonna, and the sleeping Grady cross the street to walk past Home Cookin Restaurant and behind it to their double-wide, the Rev splitting off from them to go right to his bleak little cottage. He has not spoken during the whole meeting, but he has eaten cheese and crackers and the toasted pecans.</p><p>The people who live east of the Davy highway (Bobo, Manfred, Fiji) walk together, Fiji carrying a plastic container with the remaining pecans. Fiji hands the container to Bobo. &#x201c;You and Manfred split those,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got some more at home.&#x201d; She looks both ways before she crosses Witch Light Road. The golden tabby cat, Mr. Snuggly, is waiting for her, and Bobo and Manfred watch the woman and the cat go in the front door. Bobo says, &#x201c;Hold out your hands.&#x201d; Manfred pulls a real cloth handkerchief from his pocket and holds it ready to catch half the salted pecans. Gathering up the corners, he nods his thanks, and Bobo splits away to go into the side door of the pawnshop, which leads to the stairs going up to his apartment.</p><p>Manfred unlocks the front door of his little house, which he rents from Bobo. He passes by his huge curving desk, crowded with computer equipment, to go through the little den (designed as a dining room) and back into the kitchen. He&#x2019;s full and not really...</p></p><h2>Ano Lani: Ano Honua - A Heavenly Nature, An Earthly Nature: A Spiritual Guide to the Hawaiian Lunar Calendar</h2><p>The treasure trove of knowledge and spiritual secrets revealed in Ano Lani; Ano Honua - A Heavenly Nature, An Earthly Nature, is not readily available in any other single literary resource. Written by Wendell Kalanikapuaenui Silva, a highly respected Native Hawaiian and practicing kahuna, it is exclusively dedicated to the traditional beliefs and cultural practices that illustrates the spiritual significance of the Hawaiian lunar calendar on the daily life of the indigenous Hawaiian. Shared for the first time, this work is an important legacy of spiritual wisdom handed down from Hawaii&#x2019;s unwritten history and deeply rooted in oral tradition. According to mythology, Po (night) was the sacred realm of the gods and the spiritual birthplace of all mankind. In old Hawaii, understanding the spiritual significance of astronomical phenomena and explaining the influence on the human world was within the realm and expertise of the ancient priestly class. Kahuna were highly trained as the &#x201c;chosen ones" and revered as the keepers of the ancient secrets and given the responsibility of interpreting and communicating the will of the supernatural rulers of the heavens and to the humans on earth. The ever-changing face of mahina (the moon) is a timeless celestial almanac for farmers and fisherman, but in remote antiquity it was also the astrological framework that spiritually guided the kahuna&#x2019;s study when superstition, magical practices and mystical rituals prevailed. Like many other civilizations, the ancient Hawaiians saw the powerful influence that the moon had in nature and on their daily lives. It dictated the nights for prayer, worship, religious taboos, sacrificial offerings, religious festivals, spiritual healing practices and ceremonial rites of passage. For them, the firmament not only revealed their spiritual connection to the source of all creation; it represented their direct ancestral lineage and linkage as an indigenous people to the deities of the cosmos. They looked to the heavens to help explain their past, interpret their present and guide their future as living spirit-beings. It defined the spiritual oneness that the early Hawaiians intuitively shared in union with the natural order of the universe and all things in existence. Keen observation of the evening skies, studying the phases of the moon and planets, the many shades of night held the secrets to the origins of the universe and served as an astral chart to help man navigate the path of life and offered stellar insights into the hidden realm of the spirit. This book offers in-depth perspective of the belief system of the indigenous Hawaiian people, their pre-Christian view of a person and the underlying concept of mana, or innate spiritual energy that manifests in all things. It offers a fascinating glimpse into the domain of the sacred, the realm of the mysterious and the divine connections holistically shared with the gods, nature and man. It reveals how the moon and the kahuna spiritually guided the earthly journey of the human soul. Hawaii is indeed fortunate that the haku puke (author) of this publication has chosen to share his precious mana&#x2018;o (scholarly expertise) and traditional kahuna teachings as a kahu (minister), kumu (cultural expert/resource), and kahuna pule (spiritual healer).</p><p></p><h2>The Ring of the Nibelung (Penguin Clothbound Classics)</h2><p><b>A superb new translation of one of the greatest nineteenth century poems: the libretto to Wagner&#x2019;s <i>Ring Cycle</i>, in a Penguin Classics hardcover designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith</b><br><br>The scale and grandeur of Wagner&#x2019;s <i>The Ring of the Nibelung</i> has no precedent and no successor. It preoccupied Wagner for much of his adult life and revolutionized the nature of opera, the orchestra, the demands on singers and on the audience itself. The four operas&#x2014;<i>The Rhinegold, The Valkyrie, Siegfried</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Twilight of the Gods</i>&#x2014;are complete worlds, conjuring up extraordinary mythological landscapes through sound as much as staging. Wagner wrote the entire libretto before embarking on the music. Discarding the grand choruses and bravura duets central to most operas, he used the largest musical forces in the context often of only a handful of singers on stage. The words were essential: he was telling a story and making an argument in a way that required absolute attention to what was said. The libretto for <i>The Ring</i> lies at the heart of nineteenth century culture. It is in itself a work of power and grandeur, and it had an incalculable effect on European and specifically German culture. John Deathridge&#x2019;s superb new translation, with notes and a fascinating introduction, is essential for anyone who wishes to fully engage with one of the great musical experiences.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

At a time when this clinical population is becoming more visible to clinicians, this thoughtful, extensively documented work is a real treasure. The book has already had a profound effect on the field, and has introduced many previously unaware clinicians to foundational concepts. The emphasis on therapist self-care and the ways in which the authors underscore the central importance of therapist self-awareness and self-regulation are particularly valuable."--Laura S. Brown, PhD, ABPP, past president, Division of Trauma Psychology, American Psychological Association; private practice, Seattle, Washington<br><br> "Courtois and Ford, two internationally acknowledged experts, have written a magnificent book on the nature and phase-oriented treatment of complex trauma. Destined to become an instant classic, the book is illustrated throughout with instructive case material. It is at once an excellent guide for the uninitiated and an outstanding resource for experienced clinicians in the field. As most forms of complex trauma occur in interpersonal relationships, the book's emphasis on the therapeutic relationship as the vehicle for healing contributes to its importance."--Onno van der Hart, PhD, Department of Clinical and Health Psychology (Emeritus), Utrecht University, The Netherlands<br><br> "<i>Treatment of Complex Trauma</i> is an excellent book for graduate Complex Trauma courses, as it provides a wide range of treatment strategies for clinicians to use with clients.

Bloom, MD, founder, The Sanctuary Model<br><br> "Courtois and Ford provide detailed guidelines for conducting their sequenced treatment approach, from preparation, assessment, and planning, to each of the phases of therapy. The book covers the 'meat and potatoes' of trauma therapy: ensuring client safety, cultivating the therapeutic relationship, and processing trauma memories. It includes strategies from different theoretical approaches and treatment modalities and addresses more complex processes, such as psychic emptiness and dissociation. Written with exceptional clarity, compassion, and respect, and richly illustrated with clinical material, this is an invaluable resource for clinicians."--Sandra C.

It features a stunning array of personalities, from the women peering worriedly over the side of the Mayflower to feminists having a grand old time protesting beauty pageants and bridal fairs. Courageous, silly, funny, and heartbreaking, these women shaped the nation and our vision of what it means to be female in America.</p><p>By culling the most fascinating characters -- the average as well as the celebrated -- Gail Collins, the editorial page editor at the <em>New York Times,</em> charts a journey that shows how women lived, what they cared about, and how they felt about marriage, sex, and work. She begins with the lost colony of Roanoke and the early southern "tobacco brides" who came looking for a husband and sometimes -- thanks to the stupendously high mortality rate -- wound up marrying their way through three or four. Spanning wars, the pioneering days, the fight for suffrage, the Depression, the era of Rosie the Riveter, the civil rights movement, and the feminist rebellion of the 1970s, <em>America's Women</em> describes the way women's lives were altered by dress fashions, medical advances, rules of hygiene, social theories about sex and courtship, and the ever-changing attitudes toward education, work, and politics. While keeping her eye on the big picture, Collins still notes that corsets and uncomfortable shoes mattered a lot, too.</p><p>"The history of American women is about the fight for freedom," Collins writes in her introduction, "but it's less a war against oppressive men than a struggle to straighten out the perpetually mixed message about women's roles that was accepted by almost everybody of both genders."</p><p>Told chronologically through the compelling stories of individual lives that, linked together, provide a complete picture of the American woman's experience, <em>America's Women</em> is both a great read and a landmark work of history.</p></p><p>Well researched and well written, <i>America's Women: 400 Years of Dolls, Drudges, Helpmates, and Heroines</i> is a powerful and important book. Starting with Pocahontas and Eleanor Dare (the first female colonist), this lively and fascinating history records the changes in American women's lives and the transformations in American society from the 1580s through the 2000s.<p> A history of the oft-marginalized sex must often draw from diaries and journals, which were disproportionally written by whites; as a result, African-American and Native American women are not as well represented as white in the earlier chapters of <i>America's Women</i>. However, Gail Collins writes about women of many races and ethnicities, and in fact provides more information about Native Americans, African-Americans, and Chinese, Jewish, and Italian immigrants than some general U.S. history books. She writes about rich and poor, young and old, urban and rural, slave and slave-owner, athlete and aviatrix, president's wife and presidential candidate--and, of course, men and women. And some of these women--from the justly famous, like Clara Barton and Harriet Tubman, to the undeservedly obscure, like Elizabeth Eckford and Senator Margaret Chase Smith--will not only make any woman proud to be a woman, they will make any American proud to be American.</p><p> An editor at the <i>New York Times</i>, Gail Collins has also written <i>Scorpion Tongues: Gossip, Celebrity, and American Politics</i> and, with Dan Collins, <i>The Millennium Book</i>. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><p>Gail Collins, a columnist for the <em>New York Times</em>, was the the first woman ever to serve as editorial page editor for the paper.

When I was in elementary school, I enrolled in a local track-and-field club. Much to the surprise of everyone around me, I ended up excelling as an athlete and breaking all kinds of state records. I was a fierce and dominant competitor, and I would come home to my parents with a chestful of blue first-place ribbons. I loved the feeling I got from lining up for a race and overhearing my peers say things like, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even want to race. I know Jon is going to win.&#x201d; I would run around that track like a junior Olympian god, head held high, unrivaled. I didn&#x2019;t struggle with comparison then because, in my mind, I had no equals.</p><p>Then one morning a new kid came and watched me race. I can still see him there, standing next to his dad and looking straight into my eyes. I overheard one of my friends say, &#x201c;What is he doing here? He&#x2019;s the fastest kid I have ever seen.&#x201d; At that, a new kind of emotion swept over me, one I could not articulate. It was a defense-based anxiety, and I didn&#x2019;t like it. I won that race, but something had awoken within me. Comparison. The next week, to my surprise, that &#x201c;fastest kid ever&#x201d; joined our club, and the security of my world was invaded. As we walked up to the starting line for the first race of the day, everyone paused to watch. The gun went off, and I began to pump my small arms and legs like mighty pistons. I broke away and for the briefest of moments felt comparison melt away. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something speed past me, the fastest kid ever. I spoke to my arms and legs, summoning them to new levels of performance. I gave that race all that I had, but it was not enough. For the first time in my young life, I was second. Embarrassed and ashamed, I went home in tears. Soon after that, I lost interest in athletics. Baffled, my parents tried to talk with me about what had happened. But how could an eight-year-old articulate the feeling of an ancient and primal force taking hold of his still-developing soul?<br><br></p><p><b>Peter and Comparison</b></p><p>I am thankful for the honesty of the biblical accounts and the raw and vulnerable picture they paint of Jesus&#x2019;s disciples. In these records, among the grace and glory, the failure and pain, we find a man who struggled as we do: Peter, the rock of the church. Saint Peter, the apostle of comparison. From these early accounts it is apparent that Peter was concerned with his position among the Twelve. He was among the group of disciples clamoring to be the greatest. At the Passover table he was determined not to fall away like the rest and was passionate to prove that his commitment was tried and true compared with some other disciples&#x2019;. But comparison is fickle. Despite Peter&#x2019;s intimacy with and proximity to Jesus, his resolve melted away by the fireside when confronted by a teenage girl. Just like that, it was over. Peter denied Jesus and called down curses on himself. And there we read one of the most cutting verses in the Scriptures: &#x201c;The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: &#x2018;Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.&#x2019; And he went outside and wept bitterly.&#x201d;&nbsp;[1]&nbsp;<br><br>Heartbroken and racked with guilt, Peter returned to fishing. He took up his net, and as if Jesus had never called him at all, Peter went back to the lake. He must have had lots to think about, sitting in the boat. Strange reports came in from some of the women who had followed Jesus, saying that his body was missing from the tomb. They said he had risen from the grave. Some even said that Jesus had explicitly mentioned Peter&#x2019;s name.</p><p>Then, in what must have seemed like an apparition, Christ himself appeared on the beach. When Peter realized it was the Lord, he jumped out of the boat and swam to the shore. Many have seen this as a sign of Peter&#x2019;s devotion, but I don&#x2019;t read it that way at all. I believe Peter was desperate to apologize to the Lord before the rest of the disciples showed up. &#x201c;Hey, Lord, about that thrice denial...&#x201d; The next scene contains details that can only be described as profound. In a courtyard by a fire, Peter had denied Jesus, and by a fire on a beach, Christ restored him. This conversation is recorded in John 21, and it reveals the tragic result of insecurity and comparison in the human heart.</p><p><i>When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &#x201c;Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Yes, Lord,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you know that I love you.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Jesus said, &#x201c;Feed my lambs.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Again Jesus said, &#x201c;Simon son of John, do you love me?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>He answered, &#x201c;Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Jesus said, &#x201c;Take care of my sheep.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The third time he said to him, &#x201c;Simon son of John, do you love me?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, &#x201c;Do you love me?&#x201d; He said, &#x201c;Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Jesus said, &#x201c;Feed my sheep. Very truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.&#x201d; Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, &#x201c;Follow me!&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, &#x201c;Lord, who is going to betray you?&#x201d;) When Peter saw him, he asked, &#x201c;Lord, what about him?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Jesus answered, &#x201c;If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.&#x201d;&nbsp;</i>[2]</p><p>In the middle of Peter&#x2019;s gracious restoration, he was gripped by comparison with John. &#x201c;But what about him?&#x201d; he asked, but Jesus wouldn&#x2019;t have it. In reply, Christ shot these powerful words across the bow of Peter&#x2019;s insecurity: &#x201c;What is that to you? You must follow me.&#x201d; Even in what should be the best moments of our lives, comparison lurks in the shadows, always seeking to exert itself and secure our worth at the expense of others.<br><br></p><p><b>Comparison and the Soul</b></p><p>Comparison is the root of most of the misery we feel in life. Comparison makes it impossible to view ourselves from any sort of godly perspective. It is an absolute snare for the soul. Consider what comparison does to our view of others. First, when we compare ourselves with those we perceive to be better than we are in any given area of life, the comparison produces a sense of inferiority and insecurity. Whenever we see those people, they become reminders that we don&#x2019;t have what it takes and are falling behind. We feel we must toil and strive to keep up. Yet the harder we try to do that, the more we&#x2019;re caught in a cycle of despair. Comparison erodes our sense of worth and self-esteem. And it has a flip side. When we compare ourselves with people we perceive to be inferior to us, we are filled with a sense of superiority. The people around us become constant reminders of how good we are and how well we are doing, and judgment and pride creep in. Those controlled by forces of comparison have unstable and insecure souls. Alain de Botton puts it this way:</p><p><i>The attentions of others matter to us because we are afflicted by a congenital uncertainty as to our own value, as a result of which affliction we tend to allow others&#x2019; appraisals to play a determining role in how we see ourselves. Our sense of identity is held captive by the judgements of those we live among. If they are amused by our jokes, we grow confident in our power to amuse. If they praise us, we develop an impression of high merit. And if they avoid our gaze when we enter a room or look impatient after we have revealed our occupation, we may fall into feelings of self-doubt and worthlessness.</i></p><p>Living by comparison produces a fragile soul.<br><br></p><p><b>Comparison and Community</b></p><p>Comparison not only creates an ulcer in the source of our self-worth but also makes it impossible for us to love deeply in community. As followers of Jesus, we are called to lives of sacrificial love, but it&#x2019;s impossible to give our hearts and lives away to those whom we must better in order to determine our worth. Comparison is the enemy of compassion.</p><p>In James 3 we read about the consequences that are unleashed when we use others for our own security. &#x201c;If you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth. Such &#x2018;wisdom&#x2019; does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.&#x201d; [3]&nbsp;Have you ever experienced the shock of discovering this at church? Expecting to find love, you find people treating others as commodities, manipulating and using them to feel good about themselves. And have you felt this sense of disorder and brokenness creating insecurity in you? Have you ever allowed your own practice of comparison to do this to others?</p><p>In their book <i>Friend and Foe</i>, social psychologists Adam Galinsky and Maurice Schweitzer cite a study by Emory University scientist Frans de Waal regarding comparison. De Waal trained capuchin monkeys to use stones as a sort of currency, learning to trade one of the stones for a slice of cucumber. The monkeys were perfectly content with this agreement as long as they were all getting the same thing&#x2014;a slice of cucumber&#x2014;in exchange for the stone. Then de Waal changed the social dynamic. One monkey was given a sweet grape instead of the cucumber slice, and the other went berserk. Now comparing itself with the other, the monkey became irate, refusing to trade the stones for the cucumber and sometimes even throwing the cucumber slice back in the face of the trainer. In one instance, the monkey went to the back of the cage and sulked, refusing to eat the cucumber. Meanwhile, the first monkey stole the slice and ate both the cucumber and the grape. Gilinsky and Schweitzer conclude, &#x201c;Just as monkeys eating cucumbers care about comparisons, so too do modern humans.&#x201d; When we are controlled by comparison, our God-given dignity is reduced to animal instinct and the community of love is poisoned by a need to measure ourselves against others.<br><br></p><p><b>The Causes of Comparison</b></p><p>Where does this need to compare ourselves with others come from? Where does this congenital affliction of the soul find its roots? Looking closely at ourselves, at our hidden thoughts, deepest affections, and usual behaviors, we can identify several underlying causes of comparison.</p><p><i>Identity</i></p><p>One cause is our misplaced sense of identity. All of us have been confused at one point or another about where we derive our identity from. We receive part of it from our parents, part of it from our peers as we grow and interact, part of it from friendships and romantic relationships, and part of it from our workplaces. Small parts of us have been deeply shaped by the experiences and encounters we have had in life. But our culture makes it hard to rightly order our identity so that we know, at a foundational level, who we truly are. This lack of a solid center results in our putting identities on and taking them off depending on whom we are around. We feel the need to continually reinvent ourselves to keep up. We want to appear successful in the ways our culture demands, and it can be exhausting. Pretending to be doing well; posting only images of fun, glamor, and excitement on social media; and telling only the parts of our story that preserve our glowing image are a kind of modern armor, protecting our fragile hearts. We are terrified to be seen for who we are, where we are, and what we are actually struggling with.</p><p><i>Vocational Accomplishments</i></p><p>We can often acutely feel the pressure of comparison in our careers. I once clicked on the LinkedIn profile of a friend and almost laughed out loud when I read how he described his career. In real life, he simply says, &#x201c;I work in finance.&#x201d; But online he is &#x201c;a leveraged specialist in emerging markets, working on derivatives to leverage maximum profit for investors with minimal risk.&#x201d; Choosing an identity, performing that identity for others, and then measuring our performance against others&#x2019; cultivates comparison and insecurity in its most insidious form.</p><p><i>Fear of Missing Out</i></p><p>Another cause of comparison is our fear of missing out. Because we live in a constantly connected world, we are continually aware of the lives others are living around us. We are bombarded by a stream of images depicting leisure, travel, escape, sabbaticals, early retirement, cruises, road trips, graduations, promotions, parties, and fun. To compare the monotony of our ordinary existence with this litany of the spectacular creates a deep sense of unrest and dissatisfaction with our own lives. When we take our eyes off eternity, we are swept into a frenzied effort to keep up with others. We try to cram eternity into our dash. Alain de Botton identifies the impact of this lack of eternal perspective:</p><p><i>The dangers of disappointed expectation must further be increased by any erosion of a faith in a next world. Those who can believe that what happens on earth is but a brief prelude to an eternal existence will offset any tendency to envy with the thought that the success of others is a momentary phenomenon against a backdrop of an eternal life.</i></p><p><i>But when a belief in an afterlife is dismissed as a childish and scientifically impossible opiate, the pressure to succeed and find fulfillment will inevitably be intensified by the awareness that one has only a single and frighteningly fleeting opportunity to do so. In such a context, earthly achievements can no longer be seen as an overture to what one may realize in another world; rather, they are the sum total of all that one will ever amount to.</i></p><p>If we fail to contrast the long arc of eternity with the urgency of the moment, we lose perspective and feel the need to cram eternal joy into momentary fulfillment.</p><p>When we live for the present and not for the eternal, life itself can become a heavy burden to bear.</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p><br><p>[1] Luke 22:61&#x2013;62.<br><br></p><p>[2] John 21:15&#x2013;22.<br><br></p><p>[3] James 3:14&#x2013;16.</p></p><h2>Parliamentary Procedure at a Glance: New Edition (Reference)</h2><p><b>The easy-to-use, commonsense approach to rules for group leadership, with over a million copies sold!</b><br><br>A unique, simplified, commonsense approach to rules for effective group leadership.

She is also a canning competition judge. </p><p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p>In the days before enormous supermarkets, where you can now get almost any ingredient any day of the year, preserving the harvest (during the harvest) was the only way to assure you would have fruits and vegetables to nourish your family through those long months between crops. Agricultural technology, transportation and refrigeration have changed our lifestyles dramatically. The need to preserve our own food has been eliminated, yet there is still great satisfaction in taking freshly harvested produce and turning it into delicious pickles, chutneys, salsas, relishes, salsas ... the list goes on.</p> <p>I was lucky to grow up with a mom who taught me the joys of canning preserves. Each summer we would trek to farm stands to load up on cucumbers and take over the kitchen with the production of Aunt Thelma's Bread-and-Butter Pickles -- a must to accompany grilled cheese sandwiches -- carefully slicing, salting and pickling those fresh cucumbers. Later in the summer there were baskets of peppers and tomatoes to create The Family Chili Sauce in preparation for the Christmas Eve tourti�re (in our family, you can't have one without the other!). Some years there were pickled beets; one year we got a gorgeous bushel of the most flavorful peaches from a farm on a trip to Niagara, and we made pickled peaches to share with everyone! Once salsa came into fashion, we embarked on many creations to use up those bushels of tomatoes, chile peppers and other zesty ingredients. And to this day, I can't eat a store-bought chutney or tomato sauce without wishing it was one I'd made myself.</p> <p>I like to buy as much local food as possible, but where I live, in south-central Ontario, that means a bounty between June and October and slim pickings for fresh produce the rest of the year. By buying the produce in season and turning it into savory preserves, not only do I support local agriculture, but I have an array of delicious foods to use all year long and to give to family and friends. Preserving is certainly a wonderful way to support local farmers or use up the produce you've grown in your own garden and, in turn, reduce your carbon footprint by reducing "food miles." And if you've made it yourself, you know exactly what you're eating. As well, in-season food is considerably more economical than foods imported throughout the year, and homemade preserves are much less expensive than commercially prepared ones.</p> <p>That said, I do take advantage of exotic foods to incorporate international flavors into my repertoire. They may not be local, but you can take advantage of seasonality in other countries when mangos are bountiful and on sale by the case, or fragrant pineapples call to you at the grocery store, or you want to create more exotic savory preserves.</p> <p>Yes, it can seem like a lot of work, and sometimes, about two-thirds of the way through a bushel of tomatoes, I wonder what I've gotten myself into, but there is nothing more satisfying than popping open a lovely jar of homemade pickles or chutney or chili sauce, knowing that each ingredient was prepared by hand and the freshness of the harvest is captured beneath that lid -- it's absolutely worth it.</p> <p>I hope these recipes will inspire you to embrace the joys of home canning, and I'm sure your friends and family will happily embrace the fruits (and vegetables) of your labors.</p> <p>Happy canning!</p></p><h2>The Dog in Photography / Der Hund In Der Fotografie / Le Chien Dans La Photographie: 1839-today</h2><p><p>In celebration of the world&#x2019;s favorite animal, we bring you over 400 photographs of or about dogs.

I haven't got time."<br><br>"Don't answer the phone. It might be Ellen. She talks forever."<br><br>"This is my first presentation to top management. I'd better be good and fast."<br><br>"What kind of memo is this? I haven't got time to read five pages."<br><br>"God, he talked for an hour, and I don't know what he said."<br><br>"If I get one chance to speak in the meeting, and I have to be brief, can I deliver my whole message?"<br><br>"How can I get my point across in a fifteen-minute interview?"<br><br>"They're tough businessmen. They won't listen long."<br><br>"He wants two or three minutes and that means fifteen or twenty, and it'll be a waste of time anyway."<br><br>In this hurry-hurry world, does all this sound familiar?<br><br>There are two clear and compelling reasons why 30 seconds is the ideal length of time in which to get your point across.<br><br><b>TIME CONSTRAINT</b><br><br>The first is <i>time constraint</i> -- not only on yourself, but also on those you're trying to convince.<br><br>Through my film and TV work, I've seen time and tastes change; fast food, fast cars, and fast deals are commonplace today. Time waits for no man; you have to move faster just to stay even. And to move faster, you must be concise.<br><br>Do you ever think about how people judge you and about how you judge others? Your deals, jobs, money, and success can all hang on first impressions. Isn't it true that with just a few words, an image is formed in your mind and in theirs, and you and they act accordingly? Often there's only time for a few words, so they had better be the right ones. The hour of years ago is the 30 seconds of today. To survive and move ahead in business or in any other relationship, you must be able to get your point across swiftly and succinctly in 30 seconds or less.<br><br><b>ATTENTION SPAN</b><br><br>The second and more important reason why 30 seconds is the ideal length of time to get your point across is that even when a person has time to listen to you, his mind can accept only so much information in one steady flow.<br><br>How long can you or anyone pay attention to what someone is saying without letting your mind wander off to sex, money, or the other good things in life? When I ask this question, I get answers of anywhere from four hours to four seconds. One businessman in a particularly sour mood from his most recent sales meeting said zero was the attention span of his associates. That happened to be true, but only because he always talked so long and boringly that his audience turned him off before he even opened his mouth. <i>The attention span of the average individual is 30 seconds.</i><br><br>Let me give you an example. Look around the room and concentrate on a lamp. You'll find your mind goes to something else within 30 seconds. If the lamp could move or talk, or go on and off by itself, it would recapture your attention for another 30 seconds. But without motion or change, it cannot hold you.<br><br>Think of soneone's attention span as a quarter slot machine. This machine must take in the first twenty-five cents before you can put in the second twenty-five cents. If you put in fifty cents or a dollar all at once, you'll have wasted your money and maybe even jammed the machine. It can take in only twenty-five cents at a time. Your listener can take in only 30 seconds at a time.<br><br>So if you want your listener to give up thoughts of sex and money and pay attention to you, you've got just 30 seconds. That is the attention span of the human race.<br><br><b>TELEVISION, RADIO, AND THE ATTENTION SPAN</b><br><br>Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the field of radio and television commercials. Media research has determined 30 seconds to be the attention span of the average viewer. That's why you and I live with the 30-second attention span theory every day of our listening and viewing lives. Almost all commercials on television and radio are 30 seconds long. If those commercials didn't sell the product, whether it's a refrigerator or a politician seeking votes, the whole concept of radio and television advertising would change.<br><br>When I discuss the 30-second message with people in my communications workshops, I hear the same thing over and over again: "I can't possibly make my point in such a short time."<br><br>My answer is that television and radio do it all the time. Commercials not only grab your attention but also tell you all about the product and where and when to buy it. Here's an example of a 30-second television commercial for Galpin Ford:<br><br>"Galpin purposely bought a lot of motor homes. But all the rain kept many of our customers away. We've got too many motor homes. Buy them during our three-day sale. Save up to eighteen thousand dollars off our regular list price. The savings can pay for your vacations for years. You can take up to twelve years to pay; many have an 11.9 percent finance plan. Prices start at $16,996. See Friday's <i>L.A. Times</i> sports section. Don't wait forever. It's the things you don't do that you regret."<br><br>The result was the most successful sale of motor homes in the history of Galpin Ford, one of the largest dealers in the country. The commercial told the potential buyer what he needed to know, and all within his attention span. The important point is that a lot can be said and ratained in 30 seconds. And if radio and television can do it, so can you.<br><br><b>THE SOUND BITE</b><br><br>Radio and television news also make use of the 30-second attention span. It's called the "sound bite." I asked a television news anchorwoman-reporter friend of mine, Terry Mayo, to explain to some business people just what a sound bite is, and she said:<br><br>"Because of attention span, the average time of all television news stories is one and a half minutes. The reporter needs 30 seconds to set up the story, another 30 seconds is reserved for the actuality, which means an interview or tape of what's happening, then another 30 seconds for the reporter to summarize and end the story. If I go out to interview someone about a story, I want that person to make his point in 30 seconds or less so I can pull it out and use it. That 30-second portion of the entire interview that I edit at the studio is called a 'sound bite.' If the subject doesn't make his statement in 30 seconds or less, I can't use it and it doesn't make the air."<br><br>Terry had something else to say about the 30-second rule on TV news:<br><br>"We've discovered that if you can't say it in 30 seconds, you probably can't say it at all. If you know how, you can make any point very well in 30 seconds."<br><br>An example is a moving message delivered in this dramatic and emotional television news story:<br><br>An old man had gone into the water fully clothed to save two seven-year-old children. He was still soaking wet when the television reporter interviewed him. He said, "Sure, I'm sixty-five. So what? Anybody who could swim would have gone in to save those kids, but maybe I did something else important. Maybe people should realize that when you're over sixty, you're not dead. You're productive, and retirement shouldn't be a mandatory thing."<br><br>There's a powerful message in less than 30 seconds, and the point certainly gets across. It was made by an average person under stress. It proves conclusively that you or anyone can do the same thing if you know how.<br><br>The 30-second message is always applicable, anytime and anywhere. It's a basic tool. When you master it, it'll become second nature to you. It'll create a whole new mind-set. It'll transform the way you think and deal with others every day. You'll find yourself instinctively prepared and using it all the time.<br><br>Anybody can master the art of the 30-second message by mastering a few basic principles -- and these are what you are about to learn.<br><br>Copyright � 1986 by Milo Frank</p><h2>Apples of Gold</h2><p><p><b>Here's what women are saying about Apples of Gold . . . </b></p> <p>"The lessons were awesome!

When their father has to travel to a distant city for work, the brothers take advantage of his absence to skip school and go fishing. At the forbidden nearby river, they meet a madman who persuades the oldest of the boys that he is destined to be killed by one of his siblings. What happens next is an almost mythic event whose impact-both tragic and redemptive-will transcend the lives and imaginations of the book's characters and readers. Dazzling and viscerally powerful, THE FISHERMEN is an essential novel about Africa, seen through the prism of one family's destiny.</p><p>Chigozie Obioma was born in Akure, Nigeria. His work has appeared in the <em>Virginia Quarterly Review</em>, <i>Transition </i>and <i>The Millions</i>, among others.

Despite concerns from everyone at Redwall, Bryony is convinced that Veil's goodness will prevail. But when he commits a crime that is unforgivable, he is banished from the abbey forever. Then Swartt and his hordes of searats and vermin attack Redwall, and Veil has to decide: Should he join Swartt in battle against the only creature who has ever loved him?

Today, the situation is even worse. The politically correct crowd cries out for men to be more sensitive, to tame their masculine nature. On the opposing side, the media bombards men with "macho" images of violence and lust. Is it any wonder men are left bewildered about who they should be?</p><p>In this newly revised and updated edition of <em>Healing the Masculine Soul</em>, Dalbey claims that there's hope for restoration, hope for healing-because Christ has come to heal us. God is calling men out to a relationship with Himself and calling them out to authentic manhood. "Our task is not to curse our manhood, but to redeem it," he writes.</p><p>Gordon Dalbey's refreshing, comprehensive picture of God's design for the masculine soul dares men to be as God created them to be-not as society demands. Dalbey tackles the tough issues, including work, sexuality, marriage, and fatherhood.</p><p>Book includes Study Guide.</p></p><p><p>Gordon Dalbey&nbsp;is a popular speaker at conferences and retreats around the world.

The author cares about the individual researcher and their progression of learning, engaging readers by asking questions and challenging them to think deeply, which is evidenced through the interactive lesson examples and real data provided from which students can practice various analyses. The author includes meaningful opportunities for readers to consider every aspect necessary for insightful, in-depth qualitative inquiry from initial conceptualization to representation and delivery of the work.

It bridges the gap between specialist textbooks (too analytical for the average user) and handbooks (full of detail but with little insight) providing an understanding of how each motor and drive system works. </p> <p>The fifth edition has been completely revised, updated and expanded. All of the most important types of motor and drive are covered, including d.c., induction, synchronous (including synchronous reluctance and salient Permanent Magnet), switched reluctance, and stepping. There has been significant innovation in this area since the fourth edition, particularly in the automotive, aircraft and industrial sectors, with novel motor topologies emerging, including hybrid designs that combine permanent magnet and reluctance effects. We now include a physical basis for understanding and quantifying torque production in these machines, and this leads to simple pictures that illuminate the control conditions required to optimise torque. The key converter topologies have been brought together, and the treatment of inverter switching strategies expanded. </p> <p>A new chapter is devoted to the treatment of Field Oriented control, reflecting its increasing importance for all a.c. motor drives.

It was only five years earlier that George Washington Vanderbilt purchased the first parcel of what would become his 125,000-acre estate in Asheville, North Carolina. Along with Olmsted, he commissioned the preeminent architect of the day, Richard Morris Hunt, to design the estate. The house, modeled in part on the chateaux of the Loire Valley, has become one of the greatest and most important in American architectural history. Its 255 rooms, with spectacular and finely crafted interiors, opulent furnishings (some designed by Hunt), and furniture and decorative arts objects collected by Vanderbilt from all corners of the world, have made it a rich national treasure. The estate served as the cradle of the profession of forestry in America. With Olmsted&#39;s advice and expertise, it became the first working model of a scientifically managed forest and played a critical role in the creation of our national parks. This meticulously researched book accompanies an exhibition organized by The Octagon, the Museum of the American Architectural Foundation; it chronicles Biltmore from inception, development, and construction through its Christmas 1895 opening celebrations, and into the present. Original architectural drawings, sketches, plans, presentation drawings, nineteenth-century photographs, and vibrant new color photography complete this portrait of a great landmark. Today Biltmore Estate belongs to George Washington Vanderbilt&#39;s descendants, who have opened the house to the public and have made it one of the most visited in America.</p><p><b>John Bryan</b> is a former professor of art and architectural history at the University of South Carolina.

She explains how kundalini energy--the &#x201c;liquid light of sex&#x201d; that lies at the base of the spine--is activated during these planetary transits, rising through the chakras and triggering the process of spiritual emergency, and in many cases, a cascade of health, emotional, and relationship problems as well as extreme anxiety. She shows that by understanding these astrological transits, you can be prepared for turbulent periods and successfully navigate them by creatively channeling the spiritual fire of kundalini. <br> <br>Clow provides astrological charts--now updated through 2050 for those born between 1930 and 2000--detailing the cycles of Saturn, Uranus, and Chiron, so you do not need your birth chart to use this book. She explains how to use the charts to predict the onset and completion of each kundalini activation and corresponding crisis. She shares tools for individuals and therapists to cope with the intensity of spiritual emergency and too much fire energy, unblock the chakras, and integrate the power of kundalini for physical, emotional, and spiritual growth. Reflecting on 20 years of success stories since the book&#x2019;s initial publication, Clow presents a road map for using celestial cycles to navigate positively and productively in times of great life change.</p><p>Barbara Hand Clow is an internationally acclaimed ceremonial teacher, Mayan Calendar researcher, and the author of <i>The Mayan Code</i>, <i>The Pleiadian Agenda</i>, <i>Alchemy of Nine Dimensions</i>, and <i>Awakening the Planetary Mind</i>.

Preus masterfully weds a story of friendship with the complications faced by 14-year-old Espen and his friends as Nazi restrictions and atrocities become part of their everyday lives. Espen not only has to deal with the political turmoil, but also with discovering that his best friend has joined the German cause, which Espen is committed to work against. Even his young sister, Ingrid, joins the resistance when she gets a bit older. Norway's hazardous topography adds to the adventure as Espen must ski across dangerous mountain passes in order to carry out his secret missions. This is at once a spy thriller, a coming-of-age story, and a chronicle of escalating bravery. Multidimensional characters fill this gripping tale that keeps readers riveted to the end. An informative author's note explains that Espen was inspired by Erling Storrusten, who, as a teenager, helped in the resistance movement. A "Bonus for Code Breakers" and instructions for making invisible ink are appealing additions. Preus aptly celebrates the determination of ordinary citizens in this book.

It&#x2019;s a great hiking venue where one can take self-propelled voyages of discovery and rediscovery, and it&#x2019;s small enough to cover on foot but large enough for a hiker to get some exercise&#x2015;and avoid the crowds. </p><p>Note that &#x201c;the Mall&#x201d; usually refers to the grand 2.2-mile stretch of open space between the Lincoln Memorial and the U.S. Capitol. Officially, though, the Mall is only the part east of 14th Street, and the memorials themselves lie in West Potomac Park. The entire area is under National Park Service jurisdiction. While the area between the Smithsonian museums is open green space, this walk focuses on the Tidal Basin and West Potomac Park as the area is more parklike, encompassing a greater variety of trees, shrubs, and water features. </p><p>This 4-mile, clockwise loop begins at the Smithsonian Metro stop, circles around the Tidal Basin, extends to the Lincoln Memorial, and returns to the Metro station. It features sites of historical and cultural interest, with emphasis on presidents and, inevitably, war. It is planned as a daytime and outdoor hike, but you can detour indoors if you want; just maintain a good pace between stops, be careful crossing streets, and use the paths and sidewalks. For a shorter hike, you can consult a street map. </p><p>From the Smithsonian Metro station on the Mall, head south (toward Independence Avenue) about 20 yards. Turn right onto a broad paved path alongside Jefferson Drive. Follow the path across 14th and 15th Streets Northwest, and enjoy the view of the Washington Monument to your right. Turn left on 15th Street. Cross Independence Avenue and keep straight. You will pass the Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on the left and see signs for East Potomac and West Potomac Parks. When you reach Maine Avenue, cross carefully and stay on the crosswalk. The Tidal Basin is straight ahead. As you pass by the basin boat rentals, stop to marvel at the view of the dome-shaped Jefferson Memorial. Follow the paved trail along the water to the left. Walk over a bridge and turn right to stay close to the water and walk toward the Jefferson Memorial. As you reach the memorial, step inside to view the 19-foot bronze statue and some of the inspiring words of our third president. From the steps, enjoy panoramic views that include Rosslyn, Virginia; the Washington Monument; and even a peek at the White House. </p><p>After viewing the memorial, continue along the water until you come to a stop sign. Make a right to cross the bridge and follow the trail toward the Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) Memorial. Pass the Japanese Stone Lantern on your right, and continue to the memorial. It is a unique site with four outdoor galleries that are handicapped accessible. Be sure to check out some of the sculptures and read some of the inscriptions. Exit the memorial, go down a set of steps toward the water, and proceed left as you continue around the Tidal Basin toward the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. The memorial, dedicated in 2011, features a 30-foot granite statue of Dr. King and a 450- foot wall, made from granite panels, that is inscribed with 14 excerpts of King&#x2019;s sermons and public addresses. View the memorial, and then exit from the main entrance onto Independence Avenue (straying away from the Tidal Basin). </p><p>Cross the street, and continue across a dirt path that leads to the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. Walking straight ahead, on the right you will see the DC War Memorial, a circular bandstand, built in 1931 as Washington&#x2019;s World War I memorial. Turn left to walk toward the Lincoln Memorial. There, turn left and tour the Korean War Veterans Memorial. Dedicated in 1995, it depicts soldiers in winter. Made of stainless steel, the grim figures are reflected in a polished black granite wall on which many faces are faintly etched. Return to the intersection, head for the nearby Lincoln Memorial, and climb the 56 steps (Lincoln died at age 56). Enter the great chamber to face the seated marble figure that&#x2019;s four-and-a-half times life-size. Notice Lincoln&#x2019;s fingers, bent to form the letters A and L in sign language (Lincoln supported education for the deaf, and sculptor Daniel French had a deaf son). An inscription above Lincoln&#x2019;s head celebrates his having saved the Union but ignores his role in ending slavery. As the writer later explained, the memorial&#x2015;opened in 1922&#x2015;was meant to help heal the North&#x2013;South rift, so it was best to &#x201c;avoid the rubbing of old sores.&#x201d; But architect Henry Bacon had the chamber walls inscribed with the Gettysburg Address and the second inaugural address, which make clear Lincoln&#x2019;s views. Before leaving, look for the inscription marking the spot where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his &#x201c;I Have a Dream&#x201d; speech in 1963. </p><p>Descend the steps, swing left, and head for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. After passing an information kiosk, stop near a flagpole to see <i>The Three Soldiers</i> sculpture. Then take the paved path along the base of a sunken black granite wall carrying the names of the Vietnam War dead and missing. When dedicated in 1982, the memorial, designed by Maya Lin, consisted solely of the engraved wall. As she later wrote, &#x201c;I did not want to civilize war by glorifying it or by forgetting the sacrifices involved.&#x201d; But her design provoked controversy, which led to <i>The Three Soldiers</i> being added in 1984. The nearby Vietnam Women&#x2019;s Memorial, showing three nurses aiding a fallen soldier, was added in 1993. </p><p>From there, retrace your steps to the last junction, and walk straight (east) on a paved path through Constitution Gardens. At a small lake, stay right and follow the paved waterside path to an elevated plaza. From there, follow the trail right to view the oval-shaped World War II Memorial, opened in 2004, combining granite, bronze, and fountains to create a peaceful place to remember those who served our country during that war. </p><p>Cross 17th Street and proceed to the first paved path leading to the sublimely abstract Washington Monument. When finished in 1884, the shaft topped out at about 555.5 feet. It&#x2019;s still the city&#x2019;s tallest masonry structure. Pass Sylvan Theater, the monument&#x2019;s outdoor stage, and keep straight to cross 15th and 14th Streets to return to the Smithsonian Metro station. </p><p><b>NEARBY/RELATED ACTIVITIES</b> </p><p>During or after the hike, explore the nearby museums, including The National Museum of American History (202-633-1000, americanhistory.si.edu) and The National Museum of Natural History (202-633-1000, naturalhistory.si.edu). If you&#x2019;re hungry, stop by the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center&#x2019;s food court on the lower level (202-312-1300, itcdc.com). The Federal Triangle Metro Station is across the courtyard. </p><p><b>GPS TRAILHEAD COORDINATES</b> </p><p>N38� 53.343' W77� 01.690' </p><p><b>DIRECTIONS</b> Park near the trailhead at the Smithsonian Metro station entrance within the Mall (near Independence Avenue and 12th Street).

A single event in its 400 years of history&#x2015;the Salem Witch Trials of 1692&#x2015;transformed it into the Capital of Creepy in America. But Salem is a seasonal town&#x2015;and its season happens to be Halloween. Every October, this small city of 40,000 swells to more than a quarter million as witches, goblins, ghouls, and ghosts (and their admirers) descend on Essex Street. For the fall of 2015, occult enthusiast and Edgar Award-winning writer J.W. Ocker moved his family of four to downtown Salem to experience firsthand a season with the witch, visiting all of its historical sites and macabre attractions. In between, he interviews its leaders and citizens, its entrepreneurs and visitors, its street performers and Wiccans, its psychics and critics, creating a picture of this unique place and the people who revel in, or merely weather, its witchiness. 25 b/w photographs</p><p>J. W. Ocker&nbsp;is the Edgar Award-winning author of Poe-Land: The Hallowed Haunts of Edgar Allan Poe. He runs the website OTIS: Odd Things I've Seen&nbsp;(Oddthingsiveseen.com), where he chronicles his visits to various oddities of culture, art, nature, and history. His first two books, The New England Grimpendium and The New York Grimpendium are personal travelogues of his visits to deathly sites in those regions. Both won Lowell Thomas Awards from the Society of American Travel Writers. His work has appeared in Rue Morgue Magazine, The Boston Globe, CNN, The Atlantic, and other places people stick writing. He's from Maryland, but has lived in New Hampshire since 2008.&#x201c;[A] lively chronicle&#x2015;part travel guide, part history lesson...Ocker moves easily among the archivists, historians, and performers he interviews, and he describes the carnival atmosphere that descends upon &#x201c;Witch City&#x201d; with enthusiasm and vividness.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Publisher's Weekly (starred review)</strong><br><br>&#x201c;What better place to celebrate Halloween than Salem, Massachusetts? Festivities begin with a parade on October 1 and end with Halloween parties and costumed celebrations on October 31. In between, Ocker, a travel writer with an Edgar Award, and family stay the entire month, exploring Salem&#x2019;s many attractions. Although the witch trials in 1692 only lasted for nine months, Salem has been branded &#x201c;Witch City,&#x201d; overshadowing its maritime history. Ocker samples everything: cemeteries, museums, gift shops, performances, wax museums, and more. He talks to street performers and street preachers as he tries to understand the appeals of the city. He interviews curators, haunters, costumed tour guides, a policeman, the mayor, and cemetery caretakers. Ocker devotes whole chapters to real witches, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and TV shows and movies set in Salem. His comic asides lighten the details of haunted houses, hangings, and hysteria without disrespecting the history. The result is a fresh, fun glimpse of a town that has come to grips with its sordid history and prospered. Armchair travelers will enjoy the trip.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Booklist</strong><br><br>&#x201c;An entertaining and historical guide to the varied sites of Salem, with Ocker interviewing everyone from the mayor to local archivists to men in scary costumes, covering burial sites of witch trial judges, and perhaps the most awesome Halloween street party ever described in print, with Ocker&#x2019;s good humor and touch of sarcasm marking his readable style.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Library Journal</strong></p><h2>Fairy Gardening 101: How to Design, Plant, Grow, and Create Over 25 Miniature Gardens</h2><p>Release your inner child and step into the fairy world by creating your own enchanted garden, no matter how much space you have!

Doctors shrug and say there is nothing they can do. Pastors say it is your sin or attacks of the devil that blocks your healing. This only leaves people more helpless, hopeless, afraid, ashamed, and still sick or in pain. Craig Miller experienced his own miraculous physical healing, and he has dedicated his life to helping others receive the permanent emotional and physical restoration that is available through the healing power of God. Craig ministers to the spirit and soul to identify root causes that block your healing. He lends particular focus to cases in which no cause of an illness can be identified and what to do when healing does not occur. He provides easy-to-use, step-by-step practical methods that are viable, available, affordable, and effective at bringing real solutions to long-term pain and suffering. And he includes real-life examples of healing testimonies.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>CRAIG MILLER has been ministering and counseling in church, medical, and mental health settings since 1980.&nbsp;He is a licensed Christian therapist and co-founder of Masterpeace Counseling in Tecumseh, Michigan.

He has served as a lay minister and as the director of social work for Herrick Hospital in Tecumseh.<br> Experiencing his own miraculous physical healing deepened Craig&#x2019;s passion to help people receive healing and restoration through teaching, imparting, and ministering the love and healing power of Jesus. Craig ministers to the spirit and soul (mind, will, and emotions) for God to identify the root causes that block healing of physical or emotional conditions. He also teaches and ministers through TV and radio appearances, speaking at national healing conferences, healing services, and through his other books: <i>When Feelings Don&#x2019;t Come Easy</i>, <i>When Your Mate Is Emotionally Unavailable</i>, <i>Declaring Your Worth</i>, and <i>Finding Victory When Healing Doesn&#x2019;t Happen</i>, which he coauthored with Randy Clark.<br> For more information about Craig, go to www.insightsfromtheheart.com.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;"The tools in this book expose and remove the emotional roots of medical conditions.

I thank God for sending Craig into my life as a spiritual companion and teacher."<br><i>--Fr. Jim Curtin</i><br> Pastor, St. Dennis Catholic Church, Lockport, IL<br><br>"I believe it is important for everyone to learn how to pray for the sick, and for them to know what to do when when there is no change after they pray. Because people typically do not know what to do when healing does not occur, I recommend Craig Miller's book, which gives greater awareness to identifying and releasing root issues of illness so that healing breakthrough can happen."<br> -<i>Randy Clark</i><br> Founder, Global Awakening<br><br></p><h2>Energy Work: The Secrets of Healing and Spiritual Growth</h2><p><p>This step-by-step approach to physical and emotional health shows how to use the body's energy centers to speed healing.</p><p>In <i>Energy Work</i>, Robert Bruce offers a, simple, easy-to-learn, approach to self-healing, based on his breakthrough system of Body Awareness Tactile Imaging energy work.

To ease the distance between them while she&#x2019;s in jail, Mama begins sending Saya bedtime stories inspired by Haitian folklore on cassette tape. Moved by her mother's tales and her father's attempts to reunite their family, Saya writes a story of her own&#x2014;one that just might bring her mother home for good.<br><br>With stirring illustrations, this tender tale shows the human side of immigration and imprisonment&#x2014;and shows how every child has the power to make a difference.</p><p>Edwidge Danticat was born in Haiti and came to the United States when she was twelve years old.

Every night, Saya's father writes letters to the judges, their mayor and congresswoman, and newspapers and television stations, but no one ever writes back. During their weekly visits to the detention center, Saya's mother tells her stories of the wosiy�l, or nightingale. Soon, Saya begins to receive cassette tapes in the mail from her mother and finds hope and solace in the stories Mama has recorded for her. One night, amid a great deal of sadness and frustration, Saya writes a story of her own to ease the sadness. When Papa sends her letter to a newspaper reporter, everything changes, and Saya learns the incredible power of words and stories. Danticat, who was born in Haiti, was separated from her parents until she was 12 years old and beautifully conveys a story about loss and grief and hope and joy. Staub's oil paintings are eye-catching and will hold the interest of young readers.

With more than 1,400 illustrations, many of them never published before and written by the leading design historian Pat Kirkham, this is the definitive study that design and film enthusiasts have been eagerly anticipating. Saul Bass (1920-1996) created some of the most compelling images of American post-war visual culture. Having extended the remit of graphic design to include film titles, he went on to transform the genre. His best known works include a series of unforgettable posters and title sequences for films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo and Otto Preminger's The Man With The Golden Arm and Anatomy of a Murder. He also created some of the most famous logos and corporate identity campaigns of the century, including those for major companies such as AT&amp;T, Quaker Oats, United Airlines and Minolta. His wife and collaborator, Elaine, joined the Bass office in the late 1950s. Together they created an impressive series of award-winning short films, including the Oscar-winning Why Man Creates, as well as an equally impressive series of film titles, ranging from Stanley Kubrick s Spartacus in the early 1960s to Martin Scorsese s Cape Fear and Casino in the 1990s. Designed by Jennifer Bass, Saul Bass's daughter and written by distinguished design historian Pat Kirkham who knew Saul Bass personally, this book is full of images from the Bass archive, providing an in depth account of one of the leading graphic artists of the 20th century.</p><p>Jennifer Bass is a graphic designer and artist. She has worked at CBS Television in New York and at Sussman/Prejza &amp; Company in Los Angeles. In 1994, she and her husband, Lance Glover, opened their studio, Treehouse Design Partnership in Los Angeles, working in the areas of environmental graphics, identity and book design.<br><br>Pat Kirkham is Professor in the History of Design, Decorative Arts and Culture at the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design &amp; Culture, New York. She has written and edited a number of books, including Charles and Ray Eames (1998) and Women Designers in the USA 1900-2000 (2001)."... A superb guide...." --Wall Street Journal<br><br>Saul Bass, best known for transforming the way movies begin, was in fact a designer of incredible versatility.

From Ed and Lorraine Warren, the world's most famous demonologists, comes perhaps their most incredible and horrifying case: the true story of William Ramsey, whose bizarre seizures terrified the English town of Southend-on-Sea. Believing Ramsey to be a victim of demonic possession, the Warrens arranged for the rite of exorcism to be performed. Not since the exorcist shocked the nation has there been such a such a horrifying account of a supernatural battle between good and evil within the soul of one human. Don t miss the Warrens' blockbuster films The Conjuring and Annabelle (in theaters October, 2014.) Books by Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren also include Graveyard, Ghost Hunters, The Haunted, In a Dark Place, and Satan's Harvest.</p><p>With werewolves now a hot fiction item (for instance, Michael Cadnum's St. Peter's Wolf, p. 416, or Dennis Danvers's Wilderness, p. 266), it's no surprise to see a ``true'' account of the hairy beasts. Too bad it's by the Warrens, those professional ``demonologists'' last seen facing down Satan and his minions (and Bigfoot too) in Ghost Hunters (1989). Before the Warrens enter the chronicle at hand (told in narrative, Q&amp;A-interview, and diary forms), though, we're regaled in the alphabet-block prose of their usual coauthor, Chase, with the sad saga of Bill Ramsey, the book's fourth credited author. Ramsey, you see, was the werewolf--well, actually it turns out that he wasn't a werewolf at all but, as the text describes him, a ``wolfman'' like Lon Chaney, Jr., in those 40's horror films--well, actually it turns out that he wasn't a wolfman at all but a young working-class British bloke who thought he was changing into a wolf, which is why he tried to bite all those friends and young ladies and cops and nurses. But it wasn't his fault: The Devil made him do it. Which is where the Warrens come in. In England on a promotional tour (neatly continued in the text: ```The Warrens are the most fascinating people I've ever interviewed,' '' an anonymous TV producer is quoted as saying), they learn of Ramsey's plight and pinpoint it as demonic possession. A bit of persuasion and Ramsey is off with them to the States, where their old colleague Bishop McKenna, also last seen in Ghost Hunters (``He's a very earnest and devout man. You just don't see his kind around a lot anymore,'' says Ed) exorcises the invading ``demon,'' setting Ramsey free. Skeptics, please note the Warrens' assurance that this is ``a carefully documented'' case (they forgot to include the documentation, though).

What does that mean? In&nbsp;<em>Friend of Sinners</em>, Rich Wilkerson Jr. shows readers the profound implications of the reality that Jesus calls us friends not because of who we are or what we have done, but because of who he is. While he was on earth, he knew that people needed to belong before they would want to behave. He understood that the power within him was greater than the darkness around him, so he loved fearlessly.</p><p>By following his example, we can have the same clear conviction and compassion for the lost that he did. His gospel of scandalous grace cannot be overestimated. When we embrace the truth that we all need Jesus equally and when we trust him to bring transformation in people&#x2019;s hearts, we will walk as Jesus walked, experiencing the glory of God in our own lives and in the lives of those around us.</p></p><p><p>Rich Wilkerson Jr. and his wife, DawnCher�, pastor VOUS Church, a meeting place of faith, creativity, and diversity in Miami, Florida.

And then there are words like "interesting," which she's not really sure how to feel about.</p><p>Now, at age twelve, she's starting middle school, and just when her friends who used to accept and protect her are drifting away, she receives an anonymous note saying "I know who you are, and I know what you're dealing with.

Her favorite things in the world (besides writing) are getting and giving book recommendations and sharing her love of reading with others. In her spare time, she likes eating cupcakes, running along the Mississippi River, and watching a lot of bad reality TV. <i>Sticks &amp; Stones</i> is her first novel.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;What if everything others said about you became visible on your body? This is the reality for new sixth grader Elyse. Elyse struggles with issues common to most middle schoolers: navigating the popular crowd, unrequited crushes, and changing friendships. But she also has to deal with cognadjivisibilitis, or CAV: a disease that causes words to appear all over her body whenever they're spoken aloud. It's not so bad when people say nice things about her, but the mean ones are big and itchy and compete for space. As if that's not embarrassing enough, Elyse has just discovered that anything she thinks about herself (positive or negative) shows up, too. Now somebody at her school is sending her secret notes, claiming to want to help her with her predicament. Elyse sets out to learn the identity of the mysterious letter writer, all the while working through her own issues of identity and self-acceptance. Cooper does an excellent job using the imagined CAV to explore self-esteem issues, which are so prevalent at this precarious time in life. Middle grade readers will enjoy Elyse's wry observations about school and family life, and most will relate to the agony of dealing with being different, especially during those awkward preteen and teenage years. Fans of Wonder by R.J. Palacio will enjoy this book for its similar writing style, compelling characters, and upbeat tone. VERDICT A quirky, clever, and lighthearted look at what it means to accept oneself. Highly recommended for most middle grade collections.&#x2014;Tabitha Nordby, Red River College, Manitoba, Canada</p><h2>Imagine Me Gone</h2><p><b><b>FINALIST for the PULITZER PRIZE<br></b></b><b><b><b>LONG-LISTED for the NATIONAL BOOK AWARD<br></b>WINNER of the LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZE <br>FINALIST for the NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD<br>FINALIST for the KIRKUS PRIZE<br>LONG-LISTED for the ANDREW CARNEGIE MEDAL<br><br></b></b><b>TOP 10 NOVELS OF THE YEAR -- <i>TIME, </i></b><i><b>Wall Street Journal, San Francisco Chronicle, </b></i><b>BBC,</b><i><b> </b></i><b><i>Newsday<br><br></i>ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: Barnes &amp; Noble, <i>BookPage</i>, <i>BuzzFeed</i>,<i> Elle, Financial Times</i>, <i>Huffington Post</i>, <i>Kirkus</i>, NPR, <i>Refinery29</i>, <i>Seattle Times</i>, Shelf Awareness, WBUR's <i>On Point</i><br><br>"Haslett is one of the country's most talented writers, equipped with a sixth sense for characterization" <i>--Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"Ambitious and stirring . . . With <i>Imagine Me Gone</i>, Haslett has reached another level." <i>--New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>From a Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award finalist, a ferociously intimate story of a family facing the ultimate question: how far will we go to save the people we love the most?<br><br></b>When Margaret's fianc�, John, is hospitalized for depression in 1960s London, she faces a choice: carry on with their plans despite what she now knows of his condition, or back away from the suffering it may bring her. She decides to marry him. <i>Imagine Me Gone </i>is the unforgettable story of what unfolds from this act of love and faith. At the heart of it is their eldest son, Michael, a brilliant, anxious music fanatic who makes sense of the world through parody. Over the span of decades, his younger siblings -- the savvy and responsible Celia and the ambitious and tightly controlled Alec -- struggle along with their mother to care for Michael's increasingly troubled and precarious existence. <br><br>Told in alternating points of view by all five members of the family, this searing, gut-wrenching, and yet frequently hilarious novel brings alive with remarkable depth and poignancy the love of a mother for her children, the often inescapable devotion siblings feel toward one another, and the legacy of a father's pain in the life of a family. <br><br>With his striking emotional precision and lively, inventive language, Adam Haslett has given us something rare: a novel with the power to change how we see the most important people in our lives. <br></p><p>Adam Haslett is the author of the short story collection <i>You Are Not a Stranger Here</i>, which was a Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award finalist, and the novel <i>Union Atlantic</i>, winner of the Lambda Literary Award and shortlisted for the Commonwealth Prize. His books have been translated into eighteen languages, and he has received the Berlin Prize from the American Academy in Berlin, the PEN/Malamud Award, and fellowships from the Guggenheim and Rockefeller Foundations. He lives in New York City.<b><b>Praise for<i> Imagine Me Gone:<br><br></i></b>"Haslett is one of the country's most talented writers, equipped with a sixth sense for characterization and a limber, unpretentious style. Perhaps his rarest gift is the apprehension of the invisible connections that tie people together...</b>The chapters seamlessly negotiate the passage of time...[Oldest son] Michael comes to dominate the narrative, and Haslett perfectly captures the qualities that make him both seductive and infuriating. He is a motormouth with a fitful imagination and a wicked sense of humor; his nervous energy and 'ceaseless brain' are the battery power on which the whole family runs...Haslett is alert to the reality of others, and the insinuating power of this novel comes from its framing of mental illness as a family affair. Michael's siblings are both wholly convincing characters, shaped by the abiding question of how much, or how little, they are meant to act as their brother's keepers...Most affecting of all is Margaret, who is treated with impatience by her children but possesses a capacious understanding...'What do you fear when you fear everything?' Michael wonders. 'Time passing and not passing. Death and life....This being the condition itself: the relentless need to escape a moment that never ends.' That condition, Haslett's superb novel shows, is an irreducible part of the fabric of Michael's family, as true and defining as the love that binds them."<br>&#x2015;<b>Sam Sacks</b>, <b><i>Wall Street Journal<br></i></b><br><br><b>"Ambitious and stirring . . . With <i>Imagine Me Gone</i>, Haslett has reached another level,</b> affording readers a full and luminous depiction of a mind under siege . . . By putting the readers in the same position as [oldest son] Michael's family members, Haslett has pulled off something of a brilliant trick: We feel precisely what they feel-the frustration, the protectiveness, the hope and fear and, yes, the obligation. If Michael is on the page, if his thoughts or actions are laid bare, there's a grueling sense of dread. If he's out of sight, if his thinking and whereabouts are unknown, the dread becomes all but unbearable . . . This is a book refreshingly replete with surprise. It sneaks up on you with dark and winning humor, poignant tenderness, and sentences so astute that they lift the spirit even when they're awfully, awfully sad . . . But make no mistake, <b>the novel's most rewarding surprise is its heart. </b>Again and again, the characters subtly assert that despite the expense of empathy and the predictable disappointment of love, our tendency to care for one another is warranted . . . Even when it's difficult or terrifying or impossible, <i>especially</i> when it's impossible, the impulse to calm those we hold dear is an absolute privilege."<br>&#x2015;<b>Bret Anthony Johnston</b>, <b><i>New York Times Book Review<br></i></b><br><br><b>"<i>Imagine Me Gone</i> brilliantly captures the excruciating burden of love and the role it plays in both our survival and our destruction.</b> Haslett suspends a sense of dread over you like an anvil from page one, cutting the rope that holds it in the brutal last act. You'd be a fool to look away." <br>&#x2015;<b>Julia Black</b>, <b><i>Esquire</i></b><br><br>"A richly drawn, Franzenesque canvas . . . <b>Haslett's prose shimmers as he peers unflinchingly at the risks and rewards of fighting for love."</b>&#x2015;<b><i>O, The Oprah Magazine<br></i></b><br><br>"<b>A devastating family drama . . . Haslett's considerable skills as a writer turn domestic conflicts into something more profound</b> . . . In one beautifully rendered scene after another, Haslett shows the family dealing with John's illness and Michael's descent while also managing their own conflicts . . . <i>Imagine Me Gone</i> is a handsome work . . .<b> the sort of writing that is guaranteed to turn heads."</b>&#x2015;<b>Michael Magras</b>, <b><i>Miami Herald<br></i></b><br><br><b>"Searing . . . Devastating and gorgeously written . . . Pure genius</b> . . . Haslett hits the nail on the head when it comes to describing just how anguishing and time-consuming psychiatric disorders can be, not only for the afflicted but also for the flailing loved ones trying their damnedest-and failing-to find a suitable fix . . . Haslett writes with his eyes wide open about the pitfalls of piled-on medication, the panicked late-night phone calls, the cycles of fear, frustration, and guarded hope. And herein lies the kicker: Because these chapters are told from the alternating perspective of each of the five family members, we believe every word in them and bear witness to just how complex and multi-angled the issue of mental illness can be . . . By signing on with Haslett and his characters we are given the chance to look beyond our minutiae and daily distractions in order to notice the passage of time as experienced by others. <b>We are reminded of what it is like to be truly, if fleetingly, alive."</b>&#x2015;<b>Alexis Burling</b>, <b><i>San Francisco Chronicle<br></i></b><br><br><b><i></i></b>"<b>Powerful</b> . . . <i>Imagine Me Gone</i> is a study of destructive family dynamics akin to Christina Stead's <i>The Man Who Loved Children</i> or Paul Theroux's <i>The Mosquito Coast. </i>Family here is a trap as filled with love and concern as it is with exasperation and dread. Moving with penetrating wit between the points of view of a father, mother, daughter, and two sons, the novel traces how the vein of mental illness running through this family affects every member . . . Haslett, as he turns the narrative over to first one and then the other, is uncanny in nailing how their differences in personality and temperament guide their respective actions . . . His sharp take on how minor family foibles become conflated with major family dysfunction introduces some unexpected comedy into the proceedings . . . Haslett expertly evokes family behavioral patterns that simply repeat themselves, taxing everyone's patience, before precipitating into panic-inducing crises . . . With its fugue of voices, each contributing a vital slant to the action, <i>Imagine Me Gone</i> offers rigorous formal pleasures. Yet while flirting with narrative artifice, Haslett stays keenly aware that in this family there is no explanation 'sufficient to account for the events . . . Lives weren't works of art.' In acknowledging that, <b><i>Imagine Me Gone</i> respects the mystery of how things happen the way they happen, while brilliantly conjuring the tide-like pull with which dreaded possibilities become harsh inevitability."</b>&#x2015;<b>Michael Upchurch</b>, <b><i>Boston Globe<br></i></b><br><br>"Drawing vivid scenes and compelling characters from a tragic realism, Haslett intimately connects the reader to his characters' inner lives . . . <b>A rare, complex story [with] exceptional storytelling and poignant insights [and] uplifting moments of humor, kindness, and love."</b><br>&#x2015;<b>Don Oldenburg</b>, <b><i>USA Today<br></i></b><br><br><b>"An extraordinary blend of precision, beauty, and tenderness</b> . . . Haslett's prose rises to the challenge, lushly capturing the dense fog of depression that blankets John [the father] and occasionally lifts just enough to reveal the 'beast' moving in on him. But Haslett really shows his chops channeling [oldest son] Michael's amped-up voice . . . I got caught up in the beauty of Haslett's sentences and the lives of these oh-so-human people bound by shared duress and cycles of hope. <b>Haslett's signature achievement in <i>Imagine Me Gone</i> is to temper the harrowing with the humorous while keeping a steady bead on the pathos.</b> You want sympathetic characters? You want a narrative that showcases love as a many-splendored thing capacious enough to encompass stalwart, long-suffering spouses, loyal siblings, suffocatingly obsessive crushes, and casual, noncommittal relationships (both gay and straight) that morph as if by magic into soul-sustenance? You want writing that thrums with anguish and compassion?

SPLAT! is his first book with Scholastic Press.PreSchool-Grade 1 --With the opening couplet, "One by one or two by two--/ come along, it's fun to do!," children are treated to a lively, lyrical peek into the world beyond Hometown, U. S. A. Each page (or, predominantly, double-page) shows and tells how children from very different cultures travel to school. The scope is broad, ranging from the desert sands of Egypt to Switzerland's snowy peaks. The exuberant watercolor washes (reminiscent of James Stevenson's style) complement each page's rhyming text, overflow with joy and motion, and add a visual zest that keeps the pages turning. The final bonus is two-fold. One single page lists the children's names from the story and tells where they live, e.g., "Niels and Solveig live in Norway." Following this is a world map with the children's countries shown. What fun to share the enthusiasm and questioning this book (a first for this age group) will generate.

The three little kittens may be a bit careless, but they always manage to correct their mistakes in this favorite Mother Goose rhyme.<p></p></p><p><p>Paul Galdone was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1907 and emigrated to the United States in 1928. After finishing his studies at the Art Student League and the New York School of Industrial Design, Mr. Galdone worked in the art department of a major publishing house. There he was introduced to the process of bookmaking, an activity that was soon to become his lifelong career. Before his death in 1986, Mr. Galdone illustrated almost three hundred books, many of which he himself wrote or retold. He is fondly remembered for his contemporary style, bright earthy humor, and action-filled illustrations, which will continue to delight for generations to come.</p>PreSchool-Grade 1 Galdone lends new life and sense to the verse in this exuberant retelling of the Mother Goose rhyme with four delightful feline characters. The large type is readable and inviting, with only one or two lines of text per page. Double-page spreads are filled with vibrant watercolor washes over ink sketches. While the expressions of the cats will be the focus of children's attention, there are countless details for them to discover for themselves, such as the animal-influenced decor of the cats' home, the spice cabinet filled with different varieties of catnip, and cat ancestor portraits. Children will relate to the kittens' deserved punishment for carelessness, their theatrical displays of sorrow, and their earnest efforts to get into both their mother's good graces and that delicious looking pie. This refreshingly hearty version of the nonsense verse will be as much a favorite of adult storytellers as it will be of toddler listeners. Yvonne A.

Carl Bowles was certain of it. But Bowles needed proof. Convicts at the U.S. penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, hated informants even more than they hated guards. A &#x201c;hack,&#x201d; as guards at the maximum-security prison were called, was simply doing his job. But an inmate snitch was a Judas, and the best way to deal with a rat, as far as Bowles was concerned, was to kill it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bowles had been suspicious of Hicks from the moment they met eight months earlier, when Hicks was still being held in an area of the ancient prison reserved for new inmates not yet assigned permanent cells. Hicks had stood out among the &#x201c;fish,&#x201d; prison slang for newcomers. At twenty-eight, he had a small build and pubescent appearance, but it was his demeanor that everyone noticed. Hicks was terrified. &#x201c;Guys were damn near fighting each other over him,&#x201d; Bowles recalled later. &#x201c;They said, &#x2018;Oh, we got to protect this poor kid! Why, he&#x2019;s white and he doesn&#x2019;t want anything to do with the niggers and he is afraid they are going to take him and fuck him. Somebody&#x2019;s got to do something.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bowles had been the first to actually meet Hicks. At the time, he claimed he simply wanted to give Hicks some advice, but guards suspected that the forty-seven-year-old Bowles had a different motive. The federal Bureau of Prisons identified Bowles in its files as a sexual predator, a convict who forced weaker inmates to satisfy his sexual needs. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t the goodness of his heart that caused Carl Bowles to search out Jeffrey Hicks,&#x201d; a guard remarked. &#x201c;It was a lower section of his anatomy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Except for a short stint when he was free after an escape, Bowles had spent twenty-three consecutive years in prison. A convicted cop killer, kidnapper, and triple murderer, he had been taken into custody for the first time at age twelve. Bowles had literally grown up in jail, and few inmates knew their way as well around a prison or had better jailhouse instincts.<br> &nbsp;<br> At Leavenworth, all convicts are released from their cells at six A.M., and are free to roam the large prison compound relatively unrestricted until ten P.M., when they are locked up for the night. Bowles had gone to the &#x201c;fish tier&#x201d; to meet Hicks within days after he arrived.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;First time in a penitentiary?&#x201d; Bowles had asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It can be pretty scary until a man figures out what is going on,&#x201d; Bowles had said, shaking a cigarette out of a pack for himself and then offering one to Hicks. &#x201c;Where you from?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A state joint in Michigan,&#x201d; Hicks had answered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh yeah?&#x201d; Bowles had remarked with interest. &#x201c;Well, what they got you for?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Uh, I can&#x2019;t say,&#x201d; Hicks had answered. &#x201c;I got an appeal, you know, still in court.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sure, kid,&#x201d; Bowles had replied, his mood noticeably colder. He had dropped his cigarette, stomped it on the prison&#x2019;s tile floor, and left.<br> &nbsp;<br> Months later when he recalled that meeting, Bowles explained: &#x201c;When Hicks told me he was a state prisoner from Michigan and then refused to tell me his crime, I knew there was something spooky about him. You see, there are only two reasons why the feds accept state prisoners. The guy is either such a mean son of a bitch that the state joint can&#x2019;t handle him or the state has to get rid of him because he&#x2019;ll be killed by convicts if they put him in a state joint.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now, even an idiot can see that Hicks ain&#x2019;t no ruthless motherfucker, so I figured there was something wrong with him. I figured he was a snitch.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Just because Bowles had suddenly lost interest in Hicks didn&#x2019;t mean others had. It took prison officials two weeks to process Hicks&#x2019;s paperwork, and by that time another convicted killer and alleged sexual predator had invited Hicks to move into his cell. Guards and inmates assumed Hicks was the inmate&#x2019;s &#x201c;punk&#x201d;&#x2014;serving as the convict&#x2019;s sexual partner in return for protection. But a few months after Hicks moved into the inmate&#x2019;s cell, something strange had happened. Hicks and his cellmate were accused of plotting an elaborate helicopter escape. Lieutenant Edward Gallegos, who exposed the plot, said Hicks&#x2019;s cellmate had tried to hire a helicopter pilot to swoop into the prison yard and rescue them.<br> &nbsp;<br> As punishment, Hicks was moved into an isolation cell in the prison&#x2019;s Hole. His cellmate received a worse punishment. He was sent to the federal penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, the harshest prison operated by the federal government. At Marion, prisoners were kept locked in one-man cells twenty-three hours a day and denied nearly all privileges.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The only way guards find out anything in here is when someone snitches,&#x201d; Bowles complained. &#x201c;Someone had tipped off the cops to that helicopter plot, and it sure as hell wasn&#x2019;t the guy who got shipped to Marion. After that I was certain Hicks was a snitch.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Hicks was released from the Hole, another white inmate took him in as his cell partner and sexual punk. Bowles knew this inmate. They were friends and Bowles was worried about him. He figured that Hicks was going to do something to get the inmate into trouble. Bowles decided to investigate Hicks&#x2019;s background and he began by visiting Harold Gooden.<br> &nbsp;<br> Every prison has its oddballs, and at Leavenworth, Gooden was one of them. A convicted counterfeiter, he was the only inmate in the penitentiary who subscribed to Architectural Digest. Gooden was college-educated, an honorably discharged navy veteran, and a bearded, pipe-smoking, self-proclaimed prison philosopher who passed his time by writing what he claimed was an epic novel. He also had the largest magazine collection at Leavenworth, much of it not the convicts&#x2019; typical reading materials&#x2014;Penthouse and Hustler&#x2014;but old copies of the Sunday edition of The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and Harper&#x2019;s. But these were not what Bowles had come looking for when he paused outside Gooden&#x2019;s open cell door, knocked, and waited to be invited in, a sign of respect between convicts in prison.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I need to borrow a few magazines,&#x201d; Bowles explained.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Help yourself, Carl,&#x201d; Gooden told him. &#x201c;Anything in particular?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;True crime,&#x201d; Bowles replied.<br> &nbsp;<br> Besides his rows of highbrow publications, Gooden also kept a large collection of sleazy detective magazines. He subscribed to them, not because he enjoyed reading them, but to identify inmates who had committed particularly heinous sex crimes. After snitches, the most despised inmates in Leavenworth were child molesters, rapists, and other sexual deviants. Sex offenders gave criminals a bad name, convicts claimed. Most inmates either were married or had been, and many were fathers. Like men outside prison, they didn&#x2019;t want their mothers, wives, and children to be victims of a deviant.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bowles took a few magazines and returned to his cell, where he scanned them, but he found nothing of interest and returned to Gooden&#x2019;s cell.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Carl, I think you should check out this one,&#x201d; Gooden volunteered, handing Bowles a copy of Inside Detective. Page thirty-six was folded down, so Bowles turned to it. He saw a two-column, black-and-white photograph of a freckle-faced boy grinning into the camera. Above it was a headline: STOP THE SEXUAL SADIST FROM ABDUCTING BOYS! The story below said that the thirteen-year-old boy in the picture had been forced off a road while riding his bicycle on October 19, 1986, in Green Oak Township, Michigan. The driver had jumped from his Jeep, dragged the boy inside the vehicle, and sped away. A few days later, the youngster&#x2019;s naked body was found abandoned in a forest. He had been sexually molested and strangled. When Bowles turned the page, the baby face of Jeffrey Joe Hicks stared up at him. The caption underneath the photograph read, &#x201c;Hicks has a long history of molesting children sexually.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bowles closed the magazine, said &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; and took it back to his cell. There he read the entire story. It reported that Hicks had first gotten into trouble in January 1975, when he was sixteen, and abducted a twelve-year-old boy at knife-point, forced him to swallow several tranquilizers, and molested him. Despite the seriousness of the crime, Hicks was put on five years&#x2019; probation. Seven years later, he sexually assaulted two other youngsters, but was released on probation again. Only after he was accused of kidnapping and murder was he finally jailed. At his trial, Hicks&#x2019;s attorneys admitted their client was guilty, but said he shouldn&#x2019;t be sent to prison because he was himself a victim. Hicks had been raped as a child by a psychiatrist who was supposed to be treating him for deviant behavior, they said, and it was that molestation that caused him to attack young boys. Hicks testified in his own defense, describing how he had held his victim&#x2019;s hands down and strangled the cyclist with his belt after abusing him. A jury ignored Hicks&#x2019;s plea for mercy and sentenced him to life in prison, plus sixty-five to one hundred years.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Give Bees a Chance</h2><p><b>From the author-illustrator of Children's Choice Book Award Winner <i>I'm Trying to Love Spiders</i>: a plea to please <i>give bees a chance</i>!</b><br><br>Not sure whether to high-five bees or run away from them? Well, maybe you shouldn't high-five them, but you definitely don't have to run away from them.<i>&nbsp;Give Bees a Chance</i> is for anyone who doesn't quite appreciate how extra special and important bees are to the world, and even to humankind! Besides making yummy honey, they help plants grow fruits and vegetables. And most bees wouldn't hurt a fly (unless it was in self-defense!).&nbsp;<br><br>Bethany Barton's interactive cartoon-style illustrations and hilarious narrator mean this book is full of facts <i>and </i>fun. With bees officially on the endangered animals list, it's more important now than ever to get on board with our flying, honey-making friends!</p><p><b>Bethany Barton</b> had been stung by three bees in her lifetime, but still wishes she could give bees hugs. She lives and works in Los Angeles with her rad husband (named Mike), their awesome son (named Leo), and a vegetable garden full of bees and spides (all named Lucille).<br><br>She is the author/illustrator of<i> I'm Trying to Love Spiders</i>, which won the third to fourth grade 2016 Children's Choice Book Award!Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;Barton employs the same style as in her award-winning book I'm Trying To Love Spiders, but this time bees are the topic. Readers are introduced to Edgar, a slightly thumb-shaped boy with a curlicue of hair. Edgar doesn't like bees, mainly because he doesn't want to be stung. The narrator tries to convince him of the insects' good qualities, yet Edgar continues to fret about their stingers and venom sacs. But facts about how long bees have lived on Earth and how they pollinate flowers and produce honey start to amaze Edgar. When he learns about dwindling bee populations, he decides that planting some bee-friendly flowers and keeping peace with them are pretty sweet alternatives to being frightened. The comical pen drawings with pastel-colored backgrounds, created using Adobe Photoshop, are visually pleasing. Childlike print in various sizes adds pizzazz, and the overall look is attractive. Barton explains that she has taken liberties with her bees, as they have only two legs in most of the illustrations instead of six. (The endpapers offer a more accurate depiction of different species.) Given the number of unloved animals and insects, Barton has an endless supply of subject matter to continue this refreshing, fun format. VERDICT A must for the lighter side of nonfiction. A great way to introduce bees to elementary students.&#x2014;Sandra Welzenbach, Villarreal Elementary School, San Antonio</p><h2>Whose Baby Butt?

Adler provides a practical understanding of how childhood shapes adult life, which in turn might benefit society as a whole. Unlike the culturally elitist Freud, Adler believed that the work of understanding should not be the preserve of psychologists alone, but a vital undertaking for everyone to pursue, given the bad consequences of ignorance. This approach to psychology was unusually democratic for psychoanalytic circles. It is a work that anyone can read and understand.</p><p>Long-regarded as the handbook of Individual psychology, `Understanding Human Nature&#39; provides an accessible introduction to Adler&#39;s key concepts, with which he moved away from his colleague Freud&#39;s thinking. These include inferiority/ superiority complexes; memories and dreams; love marriage and children; and sexuality and sexual problems. Adler&#39;s holistic personality-based approach to psychology continues to be relevant today to students, the general public and professionals alike.Colin Brett is an accredited Adlerian counselor and former Training Officer of the Adlerian Society of Great Britain.

Stealthy and mysterious, they are out to plunder and destroy everything in their path. And when they reach Redwall Abbey, they ruthlessly steal the most precious treasure of all-the tapestry of Martin the Warrior. It takes Dann Reguba and Song Swifteye, children of warrior squirrels, to follow in their fathers&#39; heroic footsteps. Together with the young shrew Dippler, and Burble the brave watervole, they embark upon the seemingly impossible quest. . . .</p><p>For this enchanting novel Brian Jacques has brought to bear the experience of his eventful and adventuresome life, a life which has taken him all over the world and seen him variously described as folk singer, playwright, and broadcaster. No doubt his usual writing environment--garden in summer, conservatory in winter--provides him with the ideal theater for observing the wildlife on which the book's unusual central characters are based. <p> It is, perhaps, appropriate that the story line revolves around the theft of the famous Redwall Tapestry, for <i>Marlfox</i> is a richly woven tapestry, skillfully running together threads of the magical and mythical with the "natural world," to give its audience a heady blend of fairy tale and medieval adventure. The result is a tale of grand themes and conflicting human passions played out against a backdrop of humor and uncertainty; yet the author manages never to lose sight of the reality of life as experienced by the human and animal kingdoms alike. </p><p> Young readers will gorge themselves on this literary feast, a spread worthy of comparison to other classics in this vein such as <i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>Duncton Wood</i>, <i>The Mythical Knights of the Round Table</i>, and the stories of C.S. Lewis.</p>"I sometimes think it ironic for an ex-seaman, longshoreman, truck driver, policeman, bus driver, etc., to find success writing children's novels," says Brian Jacques (pronounced "Jakes"). Yet it is all too true. With the publication of his first children's book in 1987, the award-winning <b>Redwall</b>, Jacques' fresh talent has received exceptional praise from reviewers in the United States and England. Newbery Award winner Lloyd Alexander called it "a fine work, literate, witty, filled with the excitement of genuine storytelling. Young people will surely be captivated. I hope they give their elders a chance to share the delights."<p>A well-known radio personality in his native Liverpool--as well as an actor, stand-up comic, and playwright--Brian Jacques is the host of "Jakestown" on BBC Radio Merseyside. Ever the performer, Jacques is well-known for applying his acting and entertainment background to his lively presentations to legions of young fans at schools across the United States and England.</p><p><b>Brian Jacques</b> was born in Liverpool, England on June 15th, 1939. Along with forty percent of the population of Liverpool, his ancestral roots are in Ireland, County Cork to be exact.</p><p>He grew up in the area around the Liverpool docks. His interest in adventure stories began at an early age with reading the books of: Daniel Defoe, Sir Henry Rider Haggard, Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Thomas Malory, Robert Michael Ballantyne, Robert Louis Stevenson, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Kenneth Grahame. He attended St. John's School, an inner city school that had its playground on the roof. On his first day at St. John's, at the age of ten, he had an experience that marked his potential as a writer. When given an assignment of writing a story about animals, he wrote about the bird that cleaned a crocodile's teeth. The teacher could not, and would not, believe that a ten year old could write that well. When young Brian refused to falsely say that he had copied the story, he was caned as "a liar". He had always loved to write, but it was only then, that he realized that he had a talent for writing.</p><p>Some teachers at St. John's proved to be good role models. As Mr. Jacques recalls:</p><p>"My favourite teacher was Mr. Austin Thomas. He looked like Lee Marvin. Big Man. A Captain in World War II. He came to school on a big bush bike with the haversack on back. He was a man's man. Always fair. I was fourteen at the time when Mr. Thomas introduced the class to poetry and Greek literature. (Because of him, I saved seven shillings and sixpence to buy <b>The Iliad</b> and <b>The Odyssey</b> at this dusty used book shop.)"</p><p>This interest in poetry extended to Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Goldsmith.It was also at St. John's that Brian met a teacher, Alan Durband (who also taught two Beatles, Paul McCartney and George Harrison), who, more than thirty years later would bring about a major change in his life.</p><p>After Brian finished school at fifteen, he set out to find adventure as a merchant seaman. He travelled to many far away ports, including New York, Valparaiso, San Francisco, and Yokohama. Tiring of the lonely life of a sailor, he returned to Liverpool where he worked as a railway fireman, a longshoreman, a long-distance truck driver, a bus driver, a boxer, a bobby (Police Constable 216D), a postmaster, and a stand-up comic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Penguin mourns the passing of celebrated children&#x2019;s book author Brian Jacques</b></p></p><h2>Copper: A Comics Collection</h2><p>Copper is curious, Fred is fearful.

Visit him online at www.boltcity.com.Kibuishi, editor of the high-quality Flight graphic anthologies and author-artist of the powerful Amulet series, brings his fantasy sensibility and melancholy tones to the classic adventures-of-a-boy-and-his-dog model. Originating as a webcomic of mostly single-page tales, Copper reverses the classic Charlie Brown&#x2013;Snoopy dynamic by making the boy, Copper, a bright, optimistic adventurer and plaguing the dog, Fred, with deep existential angst: Do people care about me? Why can&#x2019;t I stop worrying? Will things ever get better than this? Despite their differences, their bond remains strong through many flights of imagination&#x2014;navigating a dangerous forest of giant mushrooms, surviving a crash landing in a homemade airplane&#x2014;that run from the lyrical to the downright apocalyptic. Illustrated in a deceptively simple style, its solemn tenor and deep strangeness will make the book a hard sell to casual readers but will likely inspire heavy investment from those who prefer a somewhat off-kilter read. Includes highly informative back matter on the production end of comic books, from first concept to final color work.

Believed to be Tezuka&#x2019;s answer to the <i>gekiga</i> (dramatic comics) movement of the 60&#x2019;s, Ayako should be considered one of the better early examples of a <i>seinen</i> (young adult) narrative to be published.<br><br>Initially set in the aftermath of World War II, Ayako focuses its attention on the Tenge clan, a once powerful family of landowners living in a rural community in northern Japan.&nbsp; From the moment readers are introduced to the extended family, it is apparent that the war and American occupation have begun to erode the fabric that binds them all together.&nbsp; The increasing influence of political, economic and social change begins to tear into the many Tenge siblings, while a strange marriage agreement creates resentment between the eldest son and his sire.&nbsp; And when the family seems to have completely fallen apart, they decide to turn their collective rage on what they believe to be the source of their troubles&#x2014;the newest member of the Tenge family, the youngest sister Ayako.</p><p>Osamu Tezuka (1928-89) is the godfather of Japanese manga comics. He originally intended to become a doctor and earned his degree before turning to what was then a medium for children. His many early masterpieces include the series known in the U.S. as Astro Boy. With his sweeping vision, deftly interwined plots, feel for the workings of power, and indefatigable commitment to human dignity, Tezuka elevated manga to an art form. The later Tezuka, when he authored Buddha, often had in mind the mature readership that manga gained in the sixties and that had only grown ever since. The Kurosawa of Japanese pop culture, Osamu Tezuka is a twentieth century classic.A 2011 Eisner Award Nominee<br>A 2010<i> About.com </i>Best Manga of the Year Selection<i><br><br></i>&#x201c;Best New Seinen/Josei Manga of 2010&#x2014;Drama<br> <i>Ayako</i> depicts horrifying events, but it is beautifully presented. Connoisseurs of comics craft will find much to admire in Tezuka&#x2019;s cinematic approach to paneling, pacing, and illustration. Peter Mendelsund&#x2019;s striking design gives this 1970&#x2019;s story a modern mood to attract mature readers.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>About.com<br></i><br> &#x201c;Panel after panel flows effortlessly, composed in such a way that it draws you in, despite the cartoonish characters that Tezuka is so well known for. His scenery and backgrounds show a vibrant land slowly weighed down by filth and corruption... While I have been dismissive of Tezuka&#x2019;s work in the past, I am fully convinced by <i>Ayako</i>... This book is one of Vertical&#x2019;s finer achievements and a must-have for any Tezuka or intelligent comics fan. 9.5/10&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Comics Village</i><br><i><br></i>&#x201c;It is a portrait of humanity&#x2019;s dark side on par with Dante&#x2019;s <i>Inferno</i>... With so many interlocking storylines, all meticulously charted up to the final page, this drama plays out on a stage so grand that only Tezuka could have conceived it. Even the artwork reaches heights that are yet to be surpassed today... For pure story and visual impact, one of the best ever. A-&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Anime News Network</i><br><br> &#x201c;Like some of Vertical&#x2019;s previous long-form Tezuka releases&#x2014;<i>MW</i> and <i>Ode to Kirihito</i> in particular&#x2014;<i>Ayako</i> isn&#x2019;t afraid to get dark and dreary. In fact, <i>Ayako</i> may be one of the bleakest yet. That is, of course, said as a term of endearment; this nearly 700-page work sucks you into its twisted narrative from the very first chapter, and its grip only gets icier as the pages turn... From Peter Mendelsund&#x2019;s elegant cover design to Mari Morimoto&#x2019;s dialect-infused translation, this is another must for fans of Osamu Tezuka and comics in general.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Otaku USA</i></p><h2>I Was Here: A Travel Journal for the Curious Minded (Travel Journal for Women and Men, Travel Journal for Kids, Travel Journal with Prompts)</h2><p><p><b><strong>Trip planner Vacation journal Travel notebook</strong></b></p><p><strong>The perfect travel gift:</strong> This colorfully illustrated, guided travel book encourages users to explore the easily overlooked and wonderful everyday details encountered while traveling, whether near or far away.

The stories were first published in magazines in 1893&#x2013;94. The original publications contain illustrations, some by Rudyard's father, John Lockwood Kipling. Kipling was born in India and spent the first six years of his childhood there. After about ten years in England, he went back to India and worked there for about six-and-a-half years. These stories were written when Kipling lived in Vermont. There is evidence that it was written for his daughter Josephine, who died in 1899 aged six, after a rare first edition of the book with a poignant handwritten note by the author to his young daughter was discovered at the National Trust's Wimpole Hall in Cambridgeshire in 2010. The tales in the book (and also those in The Second Jungle Book which followed in 1895, and which includes five further stories about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons. The verses of The Law of the Jungle, for example, lay down rules for the safety of individuals, families and communities. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or "heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle." Other readers have interpreted the work as allegories of the politics and society of the time. The best-known of them are the three stories revolving around the adventures of an abandoned "man cub" Mowgli who is raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. The most famous of the other stories are probably "Rikki-Tikki-Tavi", the story of a heroic mongoose, and "Toomai of the Elephants", the tale of a young elephant-handler. As with much of Kipling's work, each of the stories is preceded by a piece of verse, and succeeded by another.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.<b>Joseph Rudyard Kipling</b> was an English short-story writer, poet, and novelist.

Learn to think about the ones you should do &#x2014; and the ones you shouldn&#x2019;t.</b></p> <p>Trading books generally break down into two categories: the ones which claim to teach you how to make money trading, and the memoir-style books recounting scandals and bad behavior. But the former don't have profitable trades to teach; if they did they'd keep those trades to themselves. And the latter are frequently entertaining, but they don't leave you with much you can apply in your own life. <i>The Laws of Trading</i> is different.</p> <p>All of our relationships and decisions involve trading at some level. This is a book about&nbsp;decision-making through the lens of a professional prop trader. For years, behavioral and cognitive scientists have shown us how human decision-making is flawed and biased. But how do you learn to avoid these problems in day-to-day decisions where you have to react in real-time?&nbsp;What are the important things to think about and to act on? The world needs a book by a prop trader who has lived, breathed and taught trading for a living,&nbsp;drawing upon years of insights on the trading floor in real markets, good and bad, whether going sideways, crashing, or bubbling over. If you can master the decision-making skills needed to profitably trade in modern markets, you can master decision-making in all walks of life. This book will teach you exactly those skills.</p> <ul> <li>Introduces, develops, and applies one law per chapter, making it easy not only to remember useful concepts, but also to have them at the ready in any situation.</li> <li>Shows you how to find and think about the &#x201c;special edge&#x201d; of your organization, and yourself.</li> <li>Teaches you how to handle the interaction of people with artificially intelligent (AI) machines that make decisions, a skill that is rapidly becoming essential in the AI-driven economy of the future.</li> <li>Includes a "bonus" digital ancillary, an&nbsp;Excel spreadsheet with various worked examples that expand on the scenarios described in the book.</li> </ul> <p>Do you need to make rational decisions in a competitive environment? Almost everyone does. This book will teach you the tools that let you do your job better.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>There are countless trading books out there. Some are useful, but a disturbingly large number of them are outdated, deceptive, or just plain wrong. Some of them claim to teach you how to make money trading, uncovering the hidden techniques and secret information to get rich in the markets. But if they really had profitable trades to teach, wouldn't they <i>keep it to themselves</i>? Others are memoirs that recount scandals and other sensationalized tales of bad behavior. While sometimes very entertaining, they really don't provide anything that readers can use in their own lives. <i>The Laws of Trading</i> is neither. It's different. It's about making decisions. </p><p>Human beings, it turns out, are largely terrible decision-makers. We underestimate small probabilities while overestimating large ones. We place great faith in our own skills and knowledge, even when there is no basis for it. It's human nature, we all do it. Academics have known this for decades, but academic knowledge doesn't necessarily help us in our daily lives: we need practical ideas for becoming better decision-makers. <i>The Laws of Trading</i> will help you: </p><ul> <li>Understand, remember, and readily access useful concepts to apply in any situation</li> <li>Learn how to identify, develop, and leverage the <i>special edge</i> that sets you apart</li> <li>Take advantage of the <i>AI moment</i> that impacts anyone who buys and sells on a daily basis in the global economy</li> <li>Explore interesting and complex decision-making situations with bonus digital tools including Excel spreadsheets and various fully-worked examples</li> </ul> <p>This book addresses the common flaws and biases in our decision-making processes and shows us how to <i>think like a trader.</i> The author has lived, breathed, and dreamt trading for much of his adult life, building a successful and profitable career in the process. Through the instructional lens of trading, you will enhance and strengthen your decision-making skills&#x2014;skills that carry over into all aspects of your life. </p><p>Trading is taking over entire industries, from advertising to catching a ride. You need concrete, accurate, and actionable knowledge to thrive in this world. Every decision is a trade. <i>The Laws of Trading</i> provides a valuable set of mental tools that will help you think about the trades you should make&#x2014;and the trades you should avoid.</p><p><b>Praise for THE LAWS OF TRADING</b> </p><p>"A fun and fascinating guide to the world of trading, ranging effortlessly from the fine details to the broad lessons we can all learn when we think like a trader."<br> <b>&#x2014;Tim??Harford,</b> author of??<i>The Undercover Economist</i>??and??<i>Fifty Things That Made the Modern Economy</i> </p><p>"Do??we??need??another??book??about how to beat the stock market written by an arrogant trader?

Past the shame. He focused on the story his <i>uba </i>had told him the night before. A story of good and evil, light and dark. A story where the triumphant sun rose high above its enemies. <br> &nbsp;<br> On instinct, his fingers reached for the calloused warmth of his <i>uba</i>&#x2019;s hand. The nursemaid from Kisun had been with him since before he could remember, but now&#x2014;like everything else&#x2014;she was gone. <br> &nbsp;<br> Now there was no one left. <br> &nbsp;<br> Against his will, the boy&#x2019;s vision cleared, locking on the clear blue of the noon sky above. His fingers curled around the stiff linen of his shirtsleeves. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Don&#x2019;t look away. If they see you looking away, they will say you are weak. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Once more, his <i>uba</i>&#x2019;s words echoed in his ears. <br> &nbsp;<br> He lowered his gaze. <br> &nbsp;<br> The courtyard before him was draped in fluttering white, surrounded on three sides by rice-paper screens. Pennants flying the golden crest of the emperor danced in a passing breeze. To the left and right stood grim-faced onlookers&#x2014; samurai dressed in the dark silks of their formal <i>hakama</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> In the center of the courtyard was the boy&#x2019;s father, kneel�ing on a small tatami mat covered in bleached canvas. He, too, was draped in white, his features etched in stone. Before him sat a low table with a short blade. At his side stood the man who had once been his best friend. <br> &nbsp;<br> The boy sought his father&#x2019;s eyes. For a moment, he thought his father looked his way, but it could have been a trick of the wind. A trick of the perfumed smoke curling above the squat brass braziers. <br> &nbsp;<br> His father would not want to look into his son&#x2019;s eyes. The boy knew this. The shame was too great. And his father would die before passing the shame of tears along to his son. <br> &nbsp;<br> The drums began to pound out a slow beat. A dirge. <br> &nbsp;<br> In the distance beyond the gates, the boy caught the muf�fled sound of small children laughing and playing. They were soon silenced by a terse shout. <br> &nbsp;<br> Without hesitation, his father loosened the knot from around his waist and pushed open his white robe, exposing the skin of his stomach and chest. Then he tucked his sleeves beneath his knees to prevent himself from falling backward. <br> &nbsp;<br> For even a disgraced samurai should die well. <br> &nbsp;<br> The boy watched his father reach for the short <i>tant&#x14d; </i>blade on the small table before him. He wanted to cry for him to stop. Cry for a moment more. A single look more.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just one.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the boy remained silent, his fingers turning bloodless in his fists. He swallowed.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Don&#x2019;t look away.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> His father took hold of the blade, wrapping his hands around the skein of white silk near its base. He plunged the sword into his stomach, cutting slowly to the left, then up to the right. His features remained passive. No hint of suffering could be detected, though the boy searched for it&#x2014;felt it&#x2014;despite his father&#x2019;s best efforts.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Never look away.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, when his father stretched his neck forward, the boy saw it. A small flicker, a grimace. In the same instant, the boy&#x2019;s heart shuddered in his chest. A hot burst of pain glimmered beneath it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man who had been his father&#x2019;s best friend took two long strides, then swung a gleaming <i>katana </i>in a perfect arc toward his father&#x2019;s exposed neck. The thud of his father&#x2019;s head hitting the tatami mat silenced the drumbeats in a hol�low start.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still the boy did not look away. He watched the crimson spurt from his father&#x2019;s folded body, past the edge of the mat and onto the grey stones beyond. The tang of the fresh blood caught in his nose&#x2014;warm metal and sea salt. He waited until his father&#x2019;s body was carried in one direction, his head in another, to be displayed as a warning. <br> &nbsp;<br> No hint of treason would be tolerated. Not even a whisper. <br> &nbsp;<br> All the while, no one came to the boy&#x2019;s side. No one dared to look him in the eye. <br> &nbsp;<br> The burden of shame took shape in the boy&#x2019;s chest, heavier than any weight he could ever bear. <br> &nbsp;<br> When the boy finally turned to leave the empty court�yard, his eyes fell upon the creaking door nearby. A nurse�maid met his unflinching stare, one hand sliding off the latch, the other clenched around two toy swords. Her skin flushed pink for an instant. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Never look away. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> The nursemaid dropped her eyes in discomfort. The boy watched as she quickly ushered a boy and a girl through the wooden gate. They were a few years younger than he and obvi�ously from a wealthy family. Perhaps the children of one of the samurai in attendance today. The younger boy straight�ened the fine silk of his kimono collar and darted past his nursemaid, never once pausing to acknowledge the presence of a traitor&#x2019;s son. <br> &nbsp;<br> The girl, however, stopped. She looked straight at him, her pert features in constant motion. Rubbing her nose with the heel of one hand, she blinked, letting her eyes run the length of him before pausing on his face. <br> &nbsp;<br> He held her gaze. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mariko-<i>sama</i>!&#x201d; the nursemaid scolded. She whispered in the girl&#x2019;s ear, then tugged her away by the elbow. <br> &nbsp;<br> Still the girl&#x2019;s eyes did not waver. Even when she passed the pool of blood darkening the stones. Even when her eyes narrowed in understanding.<br> &nbsp;<br> The boy was grateful he saw no sympathy in her expres�sion. Instead the girl continued studying him until her nurse�maid urged her around the corner.<br> &nbsp;<br> His gaze returned to the sky, his chin in high disregard of his tears.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>In the beginning, there were two suns and two moons.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> One day, the victorious son would rise&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> And set fire to all his father&#x2019;s enemies. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Illusions and Expectations </b><br> <b><i>Ten Years Later </i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> On the surface everything seemed right. <br> &nbsp;<br> An elegant litter. A dutiful daughter. An honor bestowed. <br> &nbsp;<br> Then, as if to taunt her, Mariko&#x2019;s litter lurched, jouncing her shoulder into the <i>norimono</i>&#x2019;s side. Its raised mother-of-pearl inlays would undoubtedly leave a bruise. Mariko took a deep breath, stifling the urge to grumble in the shadows like an angry crone. The smell of the <i>norimono</i>&#x2019;s varnish filled her head, bringing to mind the Dragon&#x2019;s Beard candy she favored as a child. <br> &nbsp;<br> Her dark, sickly sweet coffin, bearing her to her final rest�ing place. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mariko sank farther into the cushions. Nothing about the journey to the imperial city of Inako had gone well. Her con�voy had left later than intended and stopped all too often. At least now&#x2014;by the way the <i>norimono </i>listed forward&#x2014;Mariko could tell they were traveling down an incline. Which meant they&#x2019;d moved past the hills around the valley, more than half�way to Inako. She leaned back, hoping her weight would help balance the burden.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just as she settled in, the litter halted suddenly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mariko raised the silk screen covering the small window to her right. Dusk was starting to descend. The forest before them was shrouded in mist, its trees a jagged silhouette across a silver sky.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Mariko turned to address the nearby soldier, a young maidservant came stumbling into view. &#x201c;My lady!&#x201d; the girl gasped, righting herself against the <i>norimono</i>&#x2019;s side. &#x201c;You must be famished. I&#x2019;ve been remiss. Please forgive me for neglecting to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to forgive, Chiyo-<i>chan</i>.&#x201d; Mariko smiled kindly, but the girl&#x2019;s eyes remained wide with worry. &#x201c;It was not I who halted the convoy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Chiyo bowed low, the flowers of her makeshift hairpiece falling askew. When she stood once more, the maidservant passed along a neatly wrapped bundle of food to Mariko. Then Chiyo moved back to her post beside the litter, pausing only to return Mariko&#x2019;s warm smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why have we stopped?&#x201d; Mariko asked the nearby mem�ber of the <i>ashigaru</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> The foot soldier wiped the perspiration from his brow, then switched the long pole of his <i>naginata </i>to his other hand. Traces of sunlight glinted off its sharp blade. &#x201c;The forest.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Mariko waited, certain that could not be the extent of his explanation. <br> &nbsp;<br> Beads of sweat gathered above the soldier&#x2019;s lips. He opened his mouth to speak, but the clatter of approaching hooves stole his attention. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lady Hattori . . .&#x201d; Nobutada, one of her father&#x2019;s con�fidants and his most trusted samurai, reined in his charger beside Mariko&#x2019;s <i>norimono</i>. &#x201c;I apologize for the delay, but several of the soldiers have voiced concerns about traveling through Jukai forest.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Mariko blinked twice, her features thoughtful. &#x201c;Is there a particular reason?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now that the sun has set, they fear the <i>y&#x14d;kai</i>, and they worry&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Silly stories of monsters in the dark.&#x201d; She waved a dis�missive hand. &#x201c;Nothing more.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Nobutada paused, doubtlessly taking note of her interrup�tion. &#x201c;They also claim the Black Clan has been seen near here recently.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They claim?&#x201d; A dark eyebrow curved into Mariko&#x2019;s fore�head. &#x201c;Or they&#x2019;ve sighted them in truth?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They are merely claims.&#x201d; Nobutada lowered the chin guard beneath his horned helmet. &#x201c;Though it would be un�usual for the Black Clan to rob us, as they do not generally attack convoys containing women and children. Especially those guarded by samurai.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Mariko lingered in consideration. &#x201c;I defer to your opinion, Nobutada-<i>sama</i>.&#x201d; Recalling the foot soldier from a moment ago, she attempted a smile. &#x201c;And please see that the <i>ashigaru </i>have time to rest and take in water soon, as they appear overtired.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nobutada scowled at her last request. &#x201c;If we are forced to go around Jukai forest, it will add a full day to our journey.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then it will add a full day to our journey.&#x201d; She was already beginning to lower her screen, the awkward smile still pasted across her face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather not risk angering the emperor.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then it is an easy choice. We must lead so that others may follow, Nobutada-<i>sama</i>. You taught me that, even as a young girl.&#x201d; Mariko did not look away as she spoke. Nor did she attempt to apologize for the sharpness of her retort.<br> &nbsp;<br> His scowl deepened. Mariko smothered a sigh. She knew she was being difficult. Knew Nobutada wished for her to make a decision. At the very least, wished for her to offer an opinion.<br> &nbsp;<br> To make a useless play at control. A play Nobutada could then smugly subvert, as her elder.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a man.<br> &nbsp;<br> Try as she might, Mariko could not help the resentment simmering beneath the surface.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Control is an illusion. Expectations will not rule my days.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Not anymore.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Perhaps not easy,&#x201d; Mariko amended, her fingers toying with the edge of the screen. &#x201c;But it <i>is </i>simple.&#x201d; She softened her tone&#x2014;a pitiful attempt to mollify him. One that was sure to chafe, as her contrary nature so often did. Her brother, Kenshin, frequently gave her grief about it. Frequently told her to be less . . . peculiar. <br> &nbsp;<br> To conform, at least in these small ways. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mariko dipped her head in a bow. &#x201c;In any case, I defer to your wise judgment, Nobutada-<i>sama</i>.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> A shadow fell across his features. &#x201c;Very well, Lady Hattori. We shall proceed through Jukai forest.&#x201d; With that, he urged his charger back toward the head of the convoy. <br> &nbsp;<br> As expected, Mariko had irritated him. She&#x2019;d offered no real opinion on anything since they&#x2019;d left her family&#x2019;s home that morning. And Nobutada wanted her to play at directing him. To give him tasks befitting such a vaunted role. <br> &nbsp;<br> Tasks befitting the samurai in charge of delivering a royal bride. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mariko supposed she should care she might be arriving at Heian Castle late. <br> &nbsp;<br> Late to meet the emperor. Late to meet his second son&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> Her future husband. <br> &nbsp;<br> But Mariko did not care. Ever since the afternoon her father had informed her that Emperor Minamoto Masaru had made an offer of marriage on behalf of his son Raiden, she&#x2019;d truly not cared about much. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mariko was to be the wife of Prince Raiden, the son of the emperor&#x2019;s favorite consort. A political marriage that would elevate her father&#x2019;s standing amongst the ruling daimy&#x14d; class. <br> &nbsp;<br> She should care that she was being exchanged like prop�erty in order to curry favor. But Mariko did not. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Not anymore. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> As the <i>norimono </i>lurched forward again, Mariko reached above to adjust the slender tortoiseshell bar speared through her thick coils of hair. Tiny strips of silver and jade dangled from its ends, snarling with one another in a ceaseless war. After Mariko finished sorting them into place, her hand fell to the smaller jade bar below.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her mother&#x2019;s face took shape in her mind&#x2014;the look of determined resignation she had worn as she slid the jade orna�ment into her only daughter&#x2019;s hair.<br> &nbsp;<br> A parting gift. But not a true source of comfort.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just like her father&#x2019;s final words:<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Be a tribute to your family, Mariko-</i>chan<i>. As you were raised to be. Forswear your childish wishes. Be more than . . . this.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Mariko&#x2019;s lips pressed tight.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>It doesn&#x2019;t matter. I&#x2019;ve already taken my revenge.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> There was no reason for Mariko to dwell on these things anymore. Her life was on a clear path now. Never mind that it was not what she wanted. Never mind that there was so much left to see and learn and do. She&#x2019;d been raised for a purpose. A foolish one at that&#x2014;to be the wife of an important man when she could easily have been something else. Something more. But it did not matter. She was not a boy. And&#x2014;despite being barely seventeen&#x2014;Hattori Mariko knew her place in life. She would marry Minamoto Raiden. Her parents would have the prestige of a daughter in Heian Castle.<br> &nbsp;<br> And Mariko would be the only one to know the stain on that honor.<br> &nbsp;<br> As dusk fell and the convoy made its way deeper into the forest, the scent of warm, wet air took on a life of its own. It mixed with the iron of the earth and the green of newly trod leaves. A strange, heady perfume. Sharp and fresh, yet soft and sinister all at once. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mariko shuddered, a chill taking root in her bones. The horses around the <i>norimono </i>whickered as if in response to an unseen threat. Seeking a distraction, Mariko reached for the small parcel of food Chiyo had given her, staving off the chill by burrowing into her cushions. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Perhaps we shou...</i></p><h2>Thinking for a Change: 11 Ways Highly Successful People Approach Life andWork</h2><p>At the heart of John C.

In a pressure-filled world, the prospect of instant escape can be exhilarating. No matter the object-drugs, alcohol, food, gambling, or sex, just to name a few-addictions extend the promise of pleasure. In the end, they deliver emptiness, death, and destruction. What began as an escape from the hassles of life becomes a form of bondage with addiction. </p><p>Addiction is a voluntary slavery. Change doesn't come easily. But change is possible!&nbsp;No matter how many times you have tried and failed, there really is a way through the addictive fog. There is a guidebook for living, and, contrary to what many think, it is available to anyone, even to those enslaved by an addiction. God is not silent on this issue. His Word offers hope, and that hope is the basis of&nbsp;the Christian Counseling &amp; Educational Foundation's (CCEFs) Crossroads: A Step-by-Step Guide Away from Addiction by Christian counseling expert Edward T. Welch. </p><p>Crossroads&nbsp;was designed as a small group study for those struggling with addiction. These ten steps, presented in Welch's trademark direct, no-nonsense style, provide a biblical and practical framework for change. Welch is a wise and loving partner who walks beside readers on their journey to freedom through God. Along the way, they will learn to recognize the patterns of addiction, to choose wisdom over foolish desires, and to cling to the hope they have in Jesus, who sets captives free. </p><p>The path away from addiction has been laid by a God who is full of surprises, who faithfully pursues those enslaved even though they have deliberately avoided him. Because walking with an addict through the process of change takes wisdom, love, and perseverance, Welch has also written an easy-to-use leaders guide. In&nbsp;Crossroads: A Step-by-Step Guide Away from Addiction Facilitator's Guide, Welch walks leaders through the process of loving, connecting with, and speaking truth to a small group of addicts. </p><p>This book contains helpful observations about the mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual state common to most addicts. With access to Welch's solid theology on addiction and years of biblical counseling experience, counselors, pastors, and others with a heart for people who are hurting can play an active role in God's restorative work in the care and discipleship of those enslaved to an addiction.&nbsp;</p></p><p>Edward T. Welch, M.Div., Ph.D., is a licensed psychologist and faculty member at the Christian Counseling &amp; Educational Foundation (CCEF).

It demands a spiritual solution. No stranger to this topic, Ed Welch gently confront struggling addicts with Gods truth, both about their self-deception and the surprising grace of Jesus, who makes all things new. This study is truly centered on the person of Christ <br> --<b>Dr. Tim Clinton, </b>President, American Association of Christian Counselors<br><br>Dr. Edward Welch has pioneered the movement in biblical counseling from behavior modification into a heart centered on worshiping the one and true living God. Dr. Welch accomplishes this shift by revealing the glory of God in his redemptive work and taking it out of the hands of self-sufficiency. With Crossroads, Dr. Welch ahs found a way to morph the addicts story into the Story of God by not letting the addict identify himself with his current sin of addiction, and by calling the addict to repentance and dependence on Christ. <br> --<b>Pastor James Noriega, </b>Shepherding Pastor Specializing in Addiction, Mars Hill Church, Seattle, WA</p><h2>The US Navy&#39;s Secret Space Program and Nordic Extraterrestrial Alliance (Secret Space Programs)</h2><p>The Los Angeles Air Raid on February 24/25, 1942 opened an unprecedented chapter in the evolution of the U.S. Navy. In response to this incident, a covert research program to investigate the feasibility of exotic antigravity propulsion technologies was developed. In addition, Navy operatives were embedded in Nazi occupied Europe to learn about the Germans&#x2019; advanced flying saucer programs, and they discovered the Nazis were receiving assistance from two extraterrestrial groups with very different agendas. The debriefing of the operatives took place at Naval Air Station, San Diego, led by Rear Admiral Rico Botta. He instructed a &#x201c;Disseminator of Naval Research and Information&#x201d;, William Tompkins, to take confidential briefing packets to select think tanks, corporations and university departments around the country. Later, Tompkins worked with a number of leading aerospace companies to design massive spacecraft for a secret U.S. Navy space program, and was fatefully assisted by extraterrestrial visitors described as &#x201c;Nordics&#x201d;. An extensive number of documents substantiate Tompkins&#x2019; claims of the existence of a covert Navy program created to study, design and build deep space battle groups.

She rides into the countryside, guided only by her restlessness and her longing to escape.</p> <p>But when chance leads her to meet a French pirate, hidden within Cornwall's shadowy forests, Dona discovers that her passions and thirst for adventure have never been more aroused. Together, they embark upon a quest rife with danger and glory, one which bestows upon Dona the ultimate choice: sacrifice her lover to certain death or risk her own life to save him.</p> <p><strong>Frenchman's Creek</strong> is the breathtaking story of a woman searching for love and adventure who embraces the dangerous life of a fugitive on the seas.</p></p><p><p><strong>Daphne du Maurier</strong> was born in London in 1907, the second daughter of a famous stage actor and actress. Her first novel was published in 1931, but it was her 1938 novel Rebecca which made her one of the most successful writers of her time. Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of the book won the Best Picture Oscar in 1940, and he used her material again for his classic The Birds. In 1969, Du Maurier was created a Dame of the British Empire.</p> <p>At the age of 81, Du Maurier died at home in her beloved Cornwall, the region that had been the setting for many of her books.</p><p>One</p> <p>W hen the east wind blows up Helford river the shining waters become troubled and disturbed and the little waves beat angrily upon the sandy shores. The short seas break above the bar at ebb-tide, and the waders fly inland to the mud-flats, their wings skimming the surface, and calling to one another as they go. Only the gulls remain, wheeling and crying above the foam, diving now and again in search of food, their grey feathers glistening with the salt spray. </p> <p>The long rollers of the Channel, travelling from beyond Lizard point, follow hard upon the steep seas at the river mouth, and mingling with the surge and wash of deep sea water comes the brown tide, swollen with the last rains and brackish from the mud, bearing upon its face dead twigs and straws, and strange forgotten things, leaves too early fallen, young birds, and the buds of flowers.</p> <p>The open roadstead is deserted, for an east wind makes uneasy anchorage, and but for the few houses scattered here and there above Helford passage, and the group of bungalows about Port Navas, the river would be the same as it was in a century now forgotten, in a time that has left few memories.</p> <p>In those days the hills and the valleys were alone in splendour, there were no buildings to desecrate the rough fields and cliffs, no chimney pots to peer out of the tall woods. There were a few cottages in Helford hamlet, but they made no impression upon the river life itself, which belonged to the birds &#x2014; curlew and redshank, guillemot and puffin. No yachts rode to the tide then, as they do to-day, and that stretch of placid water where the river divides to Constantine and Gweek was calm and undisturbed.</p> <p>The river was little known, save to a few mariners who had found shelter there when the south-west gales drove them inshore from their course up-channel, and they found the place lonely and austere, a little frightening because of the silence, and when the wind was fair again were glad to weigh anchor and set sail. Helford hamlet was no inducement to a sailor ashore, the few cottage folk dull-witted and uncommunicative, and the fellow who has been away from warmth and women over-long has little desire to wander in the woods or dabble with the waders in the mud at ebb-tide. So the winding river remained unvisited, the woods and the hills untrodden, and all the drowsy beauty of midsummer that gives Helford river a strange enchantment was never seen and never known.</p> <p>To-day there are many voices to blunder in upon the silence. The pleasure steamers come and go, leaving a churning wake, and yachtsmen visit one another, and even the day-tripper, his dull eye surfeited with undigested beauty, ploughs in and out amongst the shallows, a prawning net in hand. Sometimes, in a little puffing car, he jerks his way along the uneven, muddy track that leads sharply to the right out of Helford village, and takes his tea with his fellow-trippers in the stone kitchen of the old farm building that once was Navron House. There is something of grandeur about it even now. Part of the original quadrangle still stands, enclosing the farm-yard of to-day, and the two pillars that once formed the entrance to the house, now over-grown with ivy and encrusted with lichen, serve as props to the modern barn with its corrugated roof.</p> <p>The farm kitchen, where the tripper takes his tea, was part of Navron dining-hall, and the little half-stair, now terminating in a bricked-up wall, was the stair leading to the gallery. The rest of the house must have crumbled away, or been demolished, for the square farm-building, though handsome enough, bears little likeness to the Navron of the old prints, shaped like the letter E, and of the formal garden and the park there is no trace to-day.</p> <p>The tripper eats his split and drinks his tea, smiling upon the landscape, knowing nothing of the woman who stood there once, long ago, in another summer, who caught the gleam of the river amidst the trees, as he does, and who lifted her head to the sky and felt the sun.</p> <p>He hears the homely farm-yard noises, the clanking of pails, the lowing of cattle, the rough voices of the farmer and his son as they call to each other across the yard, but his ears are deaf to the echoes of that other time, when someone whistled softly from the dark belt of trees, his hands cupped to his mouth, and was swiftly answered by the thin, stooping figure crouching beneath the walls of the silent house, while above them the casement opened, and Dona watched and listened, her hands playing a little nameless melody upon the sill, her ringlets falling forward over her face.</p> <p>The river flows on, the trees rustle in the summer wind, and down on the mud flats the oyster-catchers stand at ebb-tide scanning the shallows for food, and the curlews cry, but the men and women of that other time are forgotten, their headstones encrusted with lichen and moss, their names indecipherable.</p> <p>To-day the cattle stamp and churn the earth over the vanished porch of Navron House, where once a man stood as the clock struck midnight, his face smiling in the dim candlelight, his drawn sword in his hand.</p> <p>In spring the farmer's children gather primroses and snowdrops in the banks above the creek, their muddy boots snapping the dead twigs and the fallen leaves of a spent summer, and the creek itself, swollen with the rains of a long winter, looks desolate and grey.</p> <p>The trees still crowd thick and darkly to the water's edge, and the moss is succulent and green upon the little quay where Dona built her fire and looked across the flames and laughed at her lover, but to-day no ship lies at anchor in the pool, with rakish masts pointing to the skies, there is no rattle of chain through the hawse hole, no rich tobacco smell upon the air, no echo of voices coming across the water in a lilting foreign tongue.</p> <p>The solitary yachtsman who leaves his yacht in the open roadstead of Helford, and goes exploring up river in his dinghy on a night in midsummer, when the night-jars call, hesitates when he comes upon the mouth of the creek, for there is something of mystery about it even now, something of enchantment. Being a stranger, the yachtsman looks back over his shoulder to the safe yacht in the roadstead, and to the broad waters of the river, and he pauses, resting on his paddles, aware suddenly of the deep silence of the creek, of its narrow twisting channel, and he feels &#x2014; for no reason known to him &#x2014; that he is an interloper, a trespasser in time. He ventures a little way along the left bank of the creek, the sound of the blades upon the water seeming over-loud and echoing oddly amongst the trees on the farther bank, and as he creeps forward the creek narrows, the trees crowd yet more thickly to the water's edge, and he feels a spell upon him, fascinating, strange, a thing of queer excitement not fully understood.</p></p><h2>Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Book of Coming Forth By Day- The Book of Enlightenment</h2><p>This book is a new original translation of the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Deadbased on surviving papyri from Ancient Egypt &#34; I Know myself, I know myself, I am One With God!-From the Pert Em Heru &#34;The Ru Pert em Heru&#34; or &#34;Ancient Egyptian Book of The Dead,&#34; or &#34;Book of Coming Forth By Day&#34; as it is more popularly known, has fascinated the world since the successful translation of Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic scripture over 150 years ago. The astonishing writings in it reveal that the Ancient Egyptians believed in life after death and in an ultimate destiny to discover the Divine. The elegance and aesthetic beauty of the hieroglyphic text itself has inspired many see it as an art form in and of itself. But is there more to it than that? Did the Ancient Egyptian wisdom contain more than just aphorisms and hopes of eternal life beyond death? In this volume Dr. Muata Ashby, the author of over 25 books on Ancient Egyptian Yoga Philosophy has produced a new translation of the original texts which uncovers a mystical teaching underlying the sayings and rituals instituted by the Ancient Egyptian Sages and Saints. &#34;Once the philosophy of Ancient Egypt is understood as a mystical tradition instead of as a religion or primitive mythology, it reveals its secrets which if practiced today will lead anyone to discover the glory of spiritual self-discovery. The Pert em Heru is in every way comparable to the Indian Upanishads or the Tibetan Book of the Dead.&#34;</p><p>Muata Ashby holds a Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Religion, and a Doctor of Divinity Degree in Holistic Healing. He is also a Pastoral Counselor and Teacher of Yoga Philosophy and Discipline. Dr. Ashby received his Doctor of Divinity Degree from and is an adjunct faculty member of the American Institute of Holistic Theology. Dr. Ashby is a certification as a PREP Relationship Counselor. Dr. Ashby has been an independent researcher and practitioner of Egyptian, Indian and Chinese Yoga and psychology as well as Christian Mysticism. Dr. Ashby has engaged in Post Graduate research in advanced Jnana, Bhakti and Kundalini Yogas at the Yoga Research Foundation under the direction of Swami Jyotirmayananda. He has extensively studied mystical religious traditions from around the world and is an accomplished lecturer, musician, artist, poet, screenwriter, playwright and author of over 25 books on yoga and spiritual philosophy. He is an Ordained Minister and Spiritual Counselor and also the founder the Sema Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to spreading the wisdom of Yoga and the Ancient Egyptian mystical traditions. <p>Dr. Ashby began his research into the spiritual philosophy of Ancient Egypt and India and noticed correlations in the culture and arts of the two countries. This was the catalyst for a successful book series on the subject called "Egyptian Yoga". Now he has created a series of musical compositions which explore this unique area of music from ancient Egypt and its connection to world music.</p></p><h2>Beginner Gardening Step by Step: A Visual Guide to Yard and Garden Basics</h2><p><b>Is your lawn full of weeds?

May king-like champions arise and may the works of the evil one be destroyed.&#34; John Paul Jackson Streams Ministries International Jezebel is made for war. She is ready to fight. Are you? The spirit of Jezebel has risen to power in our culture and infiltrated the Church. Her witchcraft has wreaked mass spiritual carnage through fear, manipulation, intimidation, and domination carried out by those who fall under her spell-even those in leadership. Her wickedness has wounded and scarred countless believers, leaving them fearful, depressed, defeated, sick, and confused. Because of Jezebel, some have lost hope and aborted God&#39;s call on their lives. Her assault will continue until all of God&#39;s people are dead or defeated. Jezebel&#39;s bloodlust for death and destruction will only be stopped when met with spiritual violence. God&#39;s people must rise up in the power of the Holy Spirit to expose the spirit of Jezebel and her evil plans, gain authority, and war against her victoriously. Jezebel: The Witch Is Back, will: � Expose over 40 of Jezebel&#39;s diabolical characteristics and behaviors � Reveal familiar spirits Jezebel has aligned herself with to deceive, kill, and destroy � Identify key weapons and strategies the spirit of Jezebel uses to war against God&#39;s people, and the weapons and strategies we must use to oppose her Jezebel: The Witch Is Back will equip and empower you to wage spiritual warfare aggressively, live in spiritual victory, and experience God&#39;s limitless love and joy as you walk boldly in the call of God on your life.

Some people seem to naturally have it. Now, Huang teaches the rest of us how to create our own from the challenges and biases we think hold us back, and turning them to work in our favor.</b><br><br>How do you find a competitive edge when the obstacles feel insurmountable? How do you get people to take you seriously when they're predisposed not to, and perhaps have already written you off?<br><br>Laura Huang has come up against that problem many times--and so has anyone who's ever felt out of place or underestimated. Many of us sit back quietly, hoping that our hard work and effort will speak for itself. Or we try to force ourselves into the mold of who we think is "successful," stifling the creativity and charm that makes us unique and memorable. <br><br>In <i>Edge</i>, Huang offers a different approach. She argues that success is rarely just about the quality of our ideas, credentials, and skills, or our effort. Instead, achieving success hinges on how well we shape others' perceptions--of our strengths, certainly, but also our flaws. It's about creating our own edge by confronting the factors that seem like shortcomings and turning them into assets that make others take notice.<br><br>Huang draws from her award-winning research on entrepreneurial intuition, persuasion, and implicit decision-making, to impart her profound findings and share stories of previously-overlooked Olympians, assistants-turned-executives, and flailing companies that made momentous turnarounds. Through her deeply-researched framework, Huang shows how we can turn weaknesses into strengths and create an edge in any situation. She explains how an entrepreneur scored a massive investment despite initially being disparaged for his foreign accent, and how a first-time political candidate overcame voters' doubts about his physical disabilities.<br><br><i>Edge </i>shows that success is about knowing who you are and using that knowledge unapologetically and strategically. This book will teach you how to find your unique edge and keep it sharp.</p><p>Laura Huang is an associate professor at Harvard Business School; previously, she was an assistant professor at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. Her research has been featured in the <i>Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Forbes</i>, and <i>Nature</i>. Her research has won awards including a 2016 Kauffman Foundation Fellowship; Huang was named one of the 40 Best Business School Professors Under the Age of 40 by Poets &amp; Quants.

The book serves as a comprehensive introduction to her many myths and legends, viewed through the Divine Ancestry attributed to her in Hesiod&#x2019;s Theogony (800-700BCE), as well as an exploration of her conflation with other goddesses, archaeology, literature, and iconography.</p><p>Hekate&#x2019;s worship was never limited to one geographical region. Her presence is well attested in Greece and Turkey, as well as Egypt, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Russia, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Sicily and Southern Italy. She has possible links to Minoan Crete, her most famous temple stood in Lagina, and she was a popular goddess in ancient Athens. Her history reveals many fascinating stories: how&nbsp;<em>Hekate&nbsp;Phosphoros</em>&nbsp;saved ancient Byzantium from an invasion by Phillip II of Macedonia (father of Alexander the Great); and how a visit to her temple in Ephesus influenced&nbsp;<em>Julian the Apostate</em>, the last Pagan Emperor of Rome.</p><p>Hekate was connected to Artemis, Demeter, Persephone, Isis, Diana, Despoina and other significant goddesses, appearing in single-and triple-bodied forms, as well as theriocephalic emanations with the heads of various animals. She shared the symbols of the torch, whip, snake and dagger with the Erinyes, and wielded the key to the Mysteries, wearing variously the modius, polos, kalathos and Phrygian cap.&nbsp; She shared paeans with Dionysos, stood with Hermes at the throne of the Phrygian Kybele, and sat next to Zeus in the cult of the Empty Throne. Far from being an obscure goddess, her torches illuminated the Mysteries at Eleusis, Samothrace, Aegina and Ephesus, leading the way for initiates.</p><p><em>Suitable for reading as a standalone text by those fascinated in the history and myths related to Hekate, Circle for Hekate: History &amp; Mythology also serves as background reading for those wishing to pursue a more practical understanding of the goddess, providing a clear contextual foundation for practice. Subsequent volumes in this series build upon the foundation provided in this first book to include devotional rites, meditations, contemplations and charms, giving readers the opportunity to develop their own personal understandings and relationships with this goddess.</em></p><p><strong>About the Author<br> Sorita d&#x2019;Este </strong>is an author, researcher and priestess who has devoted her life to the Mysteries.

A MURDER. Detective Inspector Fin Macleod is sent from Edinburgh to investigate. For Lewis-born Macleod, the case represents a journey both home and into his past. A SECRET. Something lurks within the close-knit island community. Something sinister. A TRAP. As Fin investigates, old skeletons begin to surface, and soon he, the hunter, becomes the hunted.</p><p>Peter May was born and raised in Scotland. He was an award-winning journalist at the age of twenty-one and a published novelist at twenty-six. He is the million-selling author of the Lewis trilogy, the Enzo Files and the China thrillers; and of the Sunday Times bestselling standalone novels Entry Island, Runaway and Coffin Road. Peter now lives in South-West france with his wife, writer Janice Hally.*Starred Review* Scottish novelist May (whose series include the Enzo Files, starring a Scottish forensic scientist working in France) starts a projected trilogy, again with a Scottish sleuth, with a shotgun blast of a debut. Two bodies are found hanging from trees: one in Edinburgh, the other on the Isle of Lewis, the most northerly isle in the Outer Hebrides. Edinburgh cop Fin Macleod, originally from Lewis, is assigned to the case for no more reason than that he speaks Gaelic. Two narratives vie with each other. One involves Macleod&#x2019;s struggles with confronting people whom he left behind years ago. The other, which eventually informs the first, is Macleod&#x2019;s first-person memories of his life on the island. The reader knows that Macleod, against all odds, overcame poverty and bad schooling to win a spot at the University of Glasgow and that he threw it all away in his sophomore year and became a cop, a decision he&#x2019;s regretted ever since. The two narratives are brilliantly executed until they converge in an absolute stunner of an ending. The isolation and desolation of Lewis is an apt metaphor for Macleod. For once in crime fiction, a detective confronting demons from his past is not merely a stock plot device. May gives it an urgency that, by novel&#x2019;s end, makes perfect sense. A gripping plot, pitch-perfect characterization, and an appropriately bleak setting drive this outstanding series debut. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>The Art of Game of Thrones, the official book of design from Season 1 to Season 8</h2><p>Filled with gorgeous illustrations and artwork from HBO&#x2019;s hit series, <i>The Art of Game of Thrones</i> is the definitive <i>Game of Thrones</i> art collection.<br><br>The official collection of behind the scenes concept art and production design from HBO&#x2019;s landmark TV show <i>Game of Thrones</i>.

Readers will be absorbed in the nature-filled artwork that shows the birth of Jesus and the celebration of the very first Christmas in a powerful and unique way.</p><p>The cover of this book sparkles and shines with foil, embossing, and spot gloss.</p></p><p>As I hiked through the forest and streams of Northwestern Montana, Idaho, and Washington during a solo camping trip, each one of these rocks called out to me. I couldn't resist holding each one, and soon my pockets were heavy with treasures.&nbsp; I didn't know why I felt so compelled to take them home, but I did feel like a kid again, reveling in the beauty of the simplest of things. Finishing out my trip with a visit to Mom's house, free from the regular routine of life, I indulged in a morning of no plans, no expectations, and quiet, childlike wonder as I dumped out my bucket of random rocks on Mom's back porch, and absent-mindedly pushed them around.&nbsp; One rock looked distinctly like someone kneeling, so I put a round rock above it as a head, and saw Mary bowing before an angel.&nbsp; Surprised by this obvious likeness, I wondered what an angel would look like as an ordinary rock, and there in the pile it emerged.&nbsp; With six simple rocks, a miracle shined through.&nbsp; I ran upstairs to find Mom, and show her my discovery.&nbsp; We spent the morning together pushing rocks around until the entire Christmas story was found in that one bucket of rocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I wondered if each rock was designed millions of years ago for this very moment--to represent Mary or Joseph, an angel, or even our Savior. Jesus himself told the Pharisees that if his disciples "should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out," (Luke 19:40) to testify of him.&nbsp; And that is what they do in this book, and in all of nature.<br><br>Could it be that we're like that, too--designed for significance that we cannot begin to imagine, and that will inevitably be so; not by our own design, but by a power much greater and more loving than we presently comprehend?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Nature and all her beauty, diversity, and wonder will always be an important source of my connection to God. I start feeling small and disconnected when I'm too long from a walk in the woods. There is magic in the trees that cannot be explained and is reserved only for the soul who steps foot and heart onto her ground. Anyone can share in the abundance of the outdoors and be filled up with the peace and contentment of becoming part of her grandeur.&nbsp;<br>Let us bring our children to their spiritual roots and reintroduce them to their connection to all things--especially to God. We might be surprised what they will teach us when they discover that all things testify of Jesus Christ, and why.Patti Rokus spent her childhood in rural Oregon wading through streams, building forts, and looking under rocks. After a career in technology with Microsoft, British Petroleum, Nike, and others, she found her way back to her true loves--nature and God. Patti is still a wanderer, not yet rooted in one place, but can be found pocketing a few rocks on every hike throughout the Pacific Northwest.</p><h2>Harold&#39;s Fairy Tale (Further Adventures of with the Purple Crayon)</h2><p><p><strong>From the treasured creator of <em>Harold and the Purple Crayon, </em>Crockett Johnson, comes another adventure for Harold and his magical purple crayon.</strong></p><p>Unable to fall asleep one night, Harold uses his purple crayon to create his very own bedtime fairy tale, complete with castles, fairies, flying carpets, and an enchanted garden. </p><p>&#x201c;An ingenious and original little picture story in which a small boy out for a walk<strong>&#x2014;</strong>happily with a crayon in his hand<strong>&#x2014;</strong>draws himself some wonderful adventures.&#x201d; (<em>The Horn Book)</em></p></p><p>Unable to fall asleep one night, Harold uses his purple crayon to create his very own bedtime fairy tale. <p></p><p><strong>Crockett Johnson</strong> (1906&#x2013;1975) was the writer and illustrator of over twenty books for children, including the beloved classic <em>Harold and the Purple Crayon</em>, six subsequent adventures starring Harold, and <em>The Carrot Seed</em>, written by his wife, Ruth Krauss.

Deo was a young medical student who fled the genocidal civil war in Burundi in 1994 for the uncertainty of New York City. Against absurd odds--he arrived with little money and less English and slept in Central Park while delivering groceries for starvation wages--his own ambition and a few kind New Yorkers led him to Columbia University and, beyond that, to medical school and American citizenship. That his rise followed a familiar immigrant's path to success doesn't make it any less remarkable, but what gives Deo's story its particular power is that becoming an American citizen did not erase his connection to Burundi, in either his memory or his dreams for the future. Writing with the same modest but dogged empathy that made his recent <i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i> (about Deo's colleague and mentor, Dr. Paul Farmer) a modern classic, Tracy Kidder follows Deo back to Burundi, where he recalls the horrors of his narrow escape from the war and begins to build a medical clinic where none had been before. Deo's terrible journey makes his story a hard one to tell; his tirelessly hopeful but clear-eyed efforts make it a gripping and inspiring one to read. <i>--Tom Nissley</i> <p></p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Tracy Kidder on <i>Strength in What Remains </i></strong><br><br> <i>Strength in What Remains</i> is the story of Deogratias, a young man from the central African nation of Burundi. In 1993, through no fault of his own, he was forced onto a terrifying journey, a journey that split his life in two. First he made a six-months-long escape, on foot, from ethnic violence in Burundi and from genocide in Rwanda. Then, in a strange twist of fate, he was, as it were, transported to New York City, where it sometimes seemed that his travails had only just begun.<p></p> <p>I met Deo by chance 6 years ago. When I first heard his story, I had one simple thought: I would not have survived. I hoped in part to reproduce that feeling as I retold his story. I also hoped to humanize what, to most westerners anyway, is a mysterious, little-known part of the world. We hear about mass slaughter in distant countries and we imagine that murder and mayhem define those locales. Deo&#x2019;s story opens up one of those places into a comprehensible landscape&#x2014;and also opens up a part of New York that is designed to be invisible, the service entrances of the upper East Side, the camping sites that homeless people use in Central Park. But above all, I think, this is a book about coming to terms with memories. How can a person deal with memories like Deo&#x2019;s, tormenting memories, memories with a distinctly ungovernable quality?</p> <p>In the first part of <i>Strength In What Remains</i>, I recount Deo&#x2019;s story. In the second part, I tell about going back with him to the stations of his life, in New York and Burundi. So the story that I tell isn&#x2019;t only about the memories that Deo related to me. It&#x2019;s also about seeing him overtaken by memories&#x2014;again and again, and sometimes acutely. But Deo didn&#x2019;t take me to Burundi just to show me around. Giving me a tour of his past was incidental to what he was up to in the present and the future. His story has a denoument that even now amazes me. </p> <p>Deo is an American citizen. He doesn&#x2019;t have to go back to Burundi. But he has returned continually and keeps on returning, and, amid the postwar wreckage, with the help of friends and family, he has created a clinic and public health system, free to those who can&#x2019;t pay, in a rural village&#x2014;part of a beginning, Deo dreams, of a new Burundi.</p> <p>This facility was a pile of rocks when I visited the site in the summer of 2006. By the fall of 2008, it had become a medical center with several new buildings, a trained professional staff, and a fully stocked pharmacy. In its first year of operation it treated 21,000 different patients. (The organization that Deo founded and that sponsors and operates this facility is called Village Health Works.) </p> <p>Deo was very young when he went through his long travail. Several strangers helped to save him from death and despair in Burundi and New York. So did sheer courage and pluck, and also Columbia University, which he attended as an undergraduate. But when it&#x2019;s come to dealing with the burden of his memories, the public health system and clinic that he founded has been the nearest thing to a solution. In the end, it&#x2019;s neither forgetting the past nor dwelling on the past that has worked for him. For him the answer has been remembering and acting. I once asked Deo why he had studied philosophy at Columbia. He told me, "I wanted to understand what had happened to me." In the end, he received what most students of philosophy receive&#x2014;not answers, but more questions. As I was trying to describe his effort to build a clinic, I found myself writing: "Deo had discovered a way to quiet the questions he&#x2019;d been asking at Columbia. That is, he saw there might be an answer for what troubled him most about the world, an answer that lay in his hands, indeed in his memory. You had to do something."<i>&#x2014;Tracy Kidder</i></p> <p>(Photo � Gabriel Amadeus Cooney) </p>Tracy Kidder graduated from Harvard and studied at the University of Iowa.

It is also the story of a boy whose name was Pontsho, and of another girl who had a very long name. Sometimes people who have a very long name fi nd it easier to shorten it. So this other girl was called Teb. There is no room here, I&#x2019;m afraid, to give her full name, as that would take up quite a few lines. So, like everybody else, we&#x2019;ll call her Teb.<br><br>Precious&#x2019;s last name was Ramotswe,&nbsp; which sounds like this&#x2014;RAM&#x2014;OT&#x2014;SWEE. There: try it yourself&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not hard to say. She lived in a country called Botswana, which is in Africa. Botswana is very beautiful&#x2014;it has wide plains that seem to go on and on as far as the eye can see, until they join the sky, which is high and empty.<br>Sometimes, you know, when you look up at an empty sky, it seems as if it&#x2019;s singing. It is very odd, but that is how it seems. <br><br>There are hills that pop up on these plains. The hills look rather like islands, and the plains look a bit like the sea.<br><br>Precious lived with her father, Obed, in a small house outside a village. Obed was a good, kind man who wore a rather battered old hat. That hat was well-known in the village and even further away.<br><br>&#x201c;Here he comes!&#x201d; people would say when they saw his hat in the distance. &#x201c;Here comes Obed!&#x201d;<br><br>On one occasion Obed lost his hat while walking home in the dark. A wind blew up and lifted it right off his head, and because there was no light he was unable to find it. The next day, when he went back to the place where he had lost the hat, there was still no sign of it. He searched and searched, but without success.<br><br>&#x201c;You could buy a new one, Daddy,&#x201d; Precious suggested.<br><br>Obed shook his head. &#x201c;A new hat is never as comfortable as an old one,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And I loved that hat.&#x201d; He paused, looking up at his daughter. &#x201c;It saved my life, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>Precious wondered how a hat could save your life. &#x201c;Please tell me the story,&#x201d; she said. She loved her father&#x2019;s stories ,especially when he told them at bedtime.There is something very exciting about a bedtime story, and it is even better if the story is told after the lights have been turned out. The words sound different&#x2014;as if they are being whispered just for you and for nobody else. The words are all around you, like a warm blanket.<br><br>So Obed told her about the hat that evening, when it was already dark outside and the African sky was filling with stars. <br><br>&#x201c;Quite a few years ago,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;before you were even born, I worked for a while on a farm. It was a very dry place, as there was not much rain in that part of the country. But each year the rains came, and the land would turn green as the plants returned to life. That could happen so quickly&#x2014;sometimes overnight.<br><br>&#x201c;My job was to see that the cattle were getting water to drink. We had to pump the water up from deep wells. Then the cattle could satisfy their thirst. I had to go and check that everything was working properly and fix it if it was not. <br><br>&#x201c;Now, it was rather remote and empty down there, and although there were no lions, there were other wild animals&#x2014;and birds. And this is all about one of those birds&#x2014;a very dangerous bird.&#x201d;<br><br>Precious interrupted him. &#x201c;Birds can&#x2019;t be dangerous,&#x201d; she said, laughing at the thought. &#x201c;Birds are far too small.&#x201d; <br><br>Obed shook his head. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;re wrong, my darling. There are some birds that are very big.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;An eagle?&#x201d; asked Precious. <br><br>&#x201c;Bigger than that. Much bigger.&#x201d;<br><br>She thought and thought, and was still thinking when Obed said: &#x201c;An ostrich! <br><br>&#x201c;An ostrich,&#x201d; her father went on, &#x201c;is much bigger than a man, and yes, it can be very dangerous. You have to be very careful if you get too close to an ostrich because they can kick. They have these very strong legs, you see, and at the end of one of them there is a claw. You can be very badly hurt by an ostrich kick&#x2014;very, very badly hurt.&#x201d;<br><br>Precious shivered. Sometimes her father&#x2019;s stories were a little bit frightening, even if they usually ended well.<br><br>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; Obed continued, &#x201c;I was walking through the bush one day, looking for some stray cattle, and suddenly I heard a noise. It was a very strange noise, and I stopped in my tracks wondering what it was. Then I saw it. Not far away from me, looking at me with those big angry eyes that they have, was an ostrich. And I knew right away that I had disturbed this creature and that it was about to attack me. The reason why it was so angry was that I had come too close to its nest. These birds make large nests on the ground in which they lay massive eggs. Think of a hen&#x2019;s egg. Then think of an egg twenty times bigger than that&#x2014;that&#x2019;s an ostrich egg.<br><br>&#x201c;Suddenly I remembered something I had been told, and it was just as well it came back to me. Looking down on the ground, I saw a long stick that had fallen from a nearby tree. I picked this up and put my hat on the end of this stick. Then I held it up high in the air&#x2014;like this.<br><br>&#x201c;Ostriches may be strong, but they are not very bright. I had remembered being told that if you put your hat<br>on a stick and then held it up high, an ostrich would think that the hat was your head. They would also think that you were much taller than they were, and so they would leave you alone. And, do you know, it worked! The ostrich saw my hat and thought I must be a very tall and strong creature&#x2014;more than a match for her. So she backed off and I was able to continue on my way unkicked.&#x201d;<br><br>Precious breathed a sigh of relief. She did not want her father to be kicked by an ostrich&#x2014;who does?<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad it worked out well for you,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said her father. &#x201c;And now you go off to sleep, Precious, as you must be ready for school tomorrow morning.&#x201d; <br><br>Precious closed her eyes and thought of school. She had heard that there was a new family coming to the school the next day&#x2014;a boy and a girl&#x2014;and she wondered what they would be like. New people are always interesting, and she thought that perhaps they might be her friends. It was good, she thought, to have old friends, but it was also good to have new ones. <br><br>But what about the lost hat? Did Obed get it back after it had blown away? Yes, he did. It landed a long way away but when people picked it up they knew immediately whose it was, and it was returned to him a few days later none the worse for its adventure. Of course he was very pleased, and from that day onwards whenever there was a high wind, he held onto his hat very firmly. Which is what all of us should do, don&#x2019;t you think?</p><h2>To Live is Christ - Bible Study Book: The Life and Ministry of Paul</h2><p><p><b>To Live is Christ: The Life and Ministry of Paul - Bible Study Book</b> by <b> Beth Moore</b> provides a personal study experience five days a week plus viewer guides for the group video sessions of this in-depth women's Bible study on the life and ministry of Paul, the Apostle to the Gentiles.

But through a chance conversation and light bulb moment, he suddenly learned how the wealthy used leverage to create passive cash flow and abundant lifestyles.One either attracts or repels money, and most people have never diagnosed which action they are engaging in. What is extraordinary is that reading one short book can change your philosophy about money, which sets the stage for a potential life altering new relationship with money. In order to ascertain what is holding yourself back financially, you shall be urged to open your mind and think like someone who has figured out the secret to freedom. When you only earn from your own efforts, it is near impossible to break through and create wealth. But when you have leveraged income, a whole new world opens up to you. The sky becomes the limit.</p><p>Prior to becoming the pace-setter for the 300,000+ associates in his network marketing business, Brian enjoyed a successful career in real estate. Working 6-7 days a week, 8 to faint, in real estate, Brian was making good money, but had no time freedom. When he saw the network marketing model, he recognized there might be a better path for him. In under three years, by the age of 30, Brian made his first million dollars in his network marketing business. He went on to build an empire that has generated a 7-figure annual income for more than ten straight years. Brian Carruthers has become a success coach, helping people to dream again ... then helping them to achieve their dreams. He has already helped thousands of his business associates to become successful business owners, get out of the corporate world rat-race, and begin to spend real time with their families doing the things that are really important to them. Brian loves to help people, and gives of himself to that end every day. What s special about Brian is that he is still in the trenches with people. He didn&#39;t get to the top and then become a manager of people, but rather he chooses to keep leading from the front by true example. You won&#39;t hear Brian teaching theories he heard from others. Instead you will hear him say, &#34;Here s what worked that I just did this morning.&#34; Don&#39;t worry about the money, Brian says. Help enough people get what they want out of life, and you will be taken care of in a big way. Just keep investing in yourself, and encourage others to do the same. Brian explains that those who have the hunger to learn, grow, and become better will find what they need to win. Seeking knowledge from the masters is imperative. Brian sought out the very best in his field and industry, learned from them, then applied those principles and philosophies to develop the fastest growing and most successful team of entrepreneurs in the U.S. Brian has been touted by national organizations and business publications as the real deal (see Home Business magazine). His three books in the last four years have all become best sellers. Becoming such a success by this young age was not just a dream, it was his expectation. What you expect, happens, adds Brian. Now Brian s goal is to create thousands of new success stories. As our profession grows, and the people in it grow, so will their incomes.</p><h2>Loveable: Embracing What Is Truest About You, So You Can Truly Embrace Your Life</h2><p><b>"<i>Loveable</i> is a handbook for how to be human."</b> -Katherine Willis Pershey, author of <i>Very Married: Field Notes on Love and Fidelity</i><br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Loveable</i>, Dr. Kelly Flanagan writes, "We rarely remember the precious months or years when we experienced our worthiness as a fact.

Adding splashes of watercolor on larger, broader pages (and an answer key in the back!), Steig brings new life to his well-loved favorite. For the uninitiated, "C D B!" translates to "See the bee!" Other letter codes are more challenging, such as the boy leaning on a tree saying "I F-N N-E N-R-G" or a droopy decrepit man slouching in a chair labeled "O-L H." Once you get used to this abbreviated Steig-speak, all (or at least most) will become clear--"X" sometimes means "eggs," "D" is sometimes "the," and "S" can be "is" or "has," for example. Or, you can just read the letters out loud over and over until the proper phrase emerges plain as day. (The pictures help, too, of course!)

When Romare boarded that same train, he watched out the window as the world whizzed by. Later he captured those scenes in a famous painting, Watching the Good Trains Go By. Using that painting as inspiration and creating a text influenced by the jazz that Bearden loved, Jeanne Walker Harvey describes the patchwork of daily southern life that Romare saw out the train&#x2019;s window and the story of his arrival in shimmering New York City. Artists and critics today praise Bearden&#x2019;s collages for their visual metaphors honoring his past, African American culture, and the human experience. Elizabeth Zunon&#x2019;s illustrations of painted scenes blended with collage are a stirring tribute to a remarkable artist.<p><i>My Hands Sing the Blues</i> is the recipient of the 2012 IRA Childrens and Young Adults Book Award-Primary Non-Fiction, as well as the gold winner of a Moonbeam Children's Book Award in the category of Picture Book-All Ages.</p></p><p>Author Jeanne Walker Harvey lives in Ross, California.<p>Illustrator Elizabeth Zunon grew up in the Ivory Coast of West Africa and lives in Albany, New York. This is her first illustrated picture book.</p>Ages 5-8 Hands aren t known to sing, but in this picture book about the childhood of Romare Bearden, hands take on a new attribute. From snipping, to patching, to painting and pasting, this young Carolina boy finds his gift of visual creativity by using his hands to sing the blues. With a Great-grandma sharing the history of the land of the Cherokees to blues and jazz music, Bearden integrates a little of what he has experienced in his famous artwork. This book gives teachers and librarians an excellent source of the Great Migration North, life in the north and south, and how children can be inspired by it all. Illustrations incorporate collages and watercolor paintings in this biography. Children will stay attentive to the innovatively written text and colorful illustrations. Shiela Martina Keaise, Children s Librarian, Colleton County Memorial Library, Walterboro, South Carolina. Recommended. --Library Media Connection, January/February Advanced Reviews<br><br>Ages 5-8 Bearden called his art visual jazz, and this handsome, fictionalized picture-book biography stays true to his rich connections to blues rhythms. With well-chosen quotes (all documented in appended notes), the rhyming first-person narrative in Bearden s voice remembers the people and places of his childhood roots, and his memory whirls back to his growing up in the rural South and then his train journey north to Harlem. Echoing Bearden s distinctive style, the richly textured collage art combines original paintings with paper, fabrics, and photos to show Bearden as a small boy watching trains pass until he and his parents get on a train themselves, and he sees the world whizzing past: A patchwork quilt of greens and gold. The moving climax shows and tells Bearden s approach to work, blending his roots with improvisation: When I put a beat of color on an empty canvas, / I never know what s coming down the track. A lively introduction to the artist for young children and for older readers, too. --Hazel Rochman, Booklist, November 1st Issue</p><h2>Nearing Ninety: And Other Comedies of Late Life (Judith Viorst&#39;s Decades)</h2><p><b>The newest illustrated poetry collection in beloved author Judith Viorst&#x2019;s &#x201c;decade&#x201d; series (from <i>It&#x2019;s Hard to Be Hip Over Thirty </i>to<i> Unexpectedly Eighty</i>), exploring, with her signature savvy and humor, what it means to be an impending nonagenarian.</b><br><br>In <i>Nearing Ninety</i>, bestselling author Judith Viorst candidly shares the complicated joys and everyday tribulations that await us at the age of ninety, all with a large dose of humor and an understanding that nothing&#x2014;well, <i>almost</i> nothing&#x2014;in life should be taken too seriously.

Bethanne's daughter, Annie, spoke with studied nonchalance. "He still loves you, Mom."</p> <p>Bethanne's spoon hovered over her bowl of soup as they sat at a window table in their favorite cafe. This wasn't actually news and shouldn't have come as any surprise. <em>Didn't</em> come as any surprise. She'd seen the signs, as recently as this morning. These days Grant was inventing excuses to call her.</p> <p>Six years ago her world had imploded when her husband confessed that he'd fallen in love with another woman. With barely a backward glance, Grant had walked out&#x2014;out of their home, their marriage, their lives. And now he wanted back in.</p> <p>"Don't you have anything to say?" Annie asked, toying with her fork. She watched her mother intently.</p> <p>"Not really." She swallowed the soup and lowered her spoon for another taste.</p> <p>Annie, it seemed, had forgotten. But not Bethanne.</p> <p>The morning Grant told her he wanted a divorce would stay in her mind forever. He couldn't seem to get away from her fast enough. He'd retained a lawyer and advised her to do the same, then coldly informed her that all future communication would be through their lawyers. The less contact with her and their children, the better, he'd said. A clean break was best.</p> <p>Grant's decision had struck Bethanne with the force and unpredictability of a hurricane. She'd stumbled blindly through the next few months, trying to hold her family together, clinging to the semblance of normality while her world disintegrated around her. "You really don't have anything to say?" Annie prodded.</p> <p>"No," Bethanne said shortly. She swallowed another spoonful of soup and reached for the herb scone. "What disturbs me is that your father would let you do his talking for him."</p> <p>Annie had the grace to look chastened, but she pushed her food away as if she'd suddenly lost her appetite.</p> <p>At one time Bethanne had dreamed Grant would regret what he'd done, that he'd seek her forgiveness and come crawling back to her. She'd wanted him to suffer for the way he'd treated her, for the hurt he'd inflicted when he'd turned his back on their children.</p> <p>But in the years since the divorce, Bethanne had gradually found her footing and, in the process, discovered a self she didn't know existed&#x2014;a stronger, independent Bethanne, a woman forged in the fire of despair. Now her two children were on their own; her oldest, Andrew, was engaged to be married in a few weeks, following his graduation from law school. As for her daughter, Annie was a year from obtaining her MBA. She worked part-time with Bethanne on the creative end of the party business Bethanne had established in the wake of her divorce.</p> <p>During her twenty years of marriage, Bethanne had become known for her lavish and inventive parties. She'd taken pride in making Grant look good by hosting unforgettable events for clients and potential clients&#x2014;an invitation to Grant's home became a sought-after privilege in certain circles. Her birthday parties for Andrew and Annie were legendary. But never once had she</p> <p>dreamed that her party-giving skills would eventually be parlayed into such a success.</p> <p>She'd started the business, which she called simply Parties, as a way of making enough money to continue living in their family home, although she'd had to take out a substantial second mortgage to get Parties off the ground. Grant had paid the required support, but depending on that would've meant moving to a smaller house in a different neighborhood. If ever her children needed stability, she knew, it was in the period after the divorce. She'd since paid off both mortgages.</p> <p>To Bethanne's astonishment, the business had taken off immediately. She'd started small, with themed birthday parties for children. The Alice in Wonderland Tea Party had been the most popular of the dozens of concepts she'd created. With busy schedules, parents were looking for an easy, economical way to make birthday parties special. Bethanne's company had filled that need.</p> <p>Currently, there were five Parties stores in the Seattle area, including the original location, and she was considering a deal that offered national franchising opportunities. The key was to keep the ideas fresh and the prices reasonable. This past winter she'd added a "birthday party in a box"&#x2014;more scaled-down, do-it-yourself versions of her trademarked theme parties.</p> <p>A year earlier Bethanne had hired Julia Hayden as her corporate operations manager. Julia was efficient, dedicated and gifted. She loved the job and had begun overseeing the company's day&#x2013;to&#x2013;day activities, freeing Bethanne to focus on creative development. Annie worked with her, and the two of them had recently developed birthday party ideas for cats and dogs, which was now a popular trend, especially among childless, affluent professionals. They'd expanded into other types of parties, too&#x2014;anniversary and retirement celebrations, Christmas and even Halloween events.</p> <p>Bethanne signaled for the check, and they went their separate ways with a quick hug and a wave. Annie was walking back to the office, while Bethanne headed for Blossom Street and A Good Yarn. Knitting had become one of her favourite activities. When</p> <p>she needed to think, nothing helped more than sitting down with a knitting project. She felt a sense of happy anticipation as she parked in front of the yarn store, which was owned by her dear friend Lydia Goetz.</p> <p>With the wedding only six weeks away, she'd wanted to knit something for Courtney, her almost-daughter-in-law, to wear during the wedding.</p> <p><em>The wedding</em>. It was why Grant had called her two weeks ago&#x2014; their son's marriage had given him a legitimate excuse&#x2014;and he'd called twice since then, including this morning.</p> <p>Other than the occasional joint decisions they'd made regarding their children, they'd had little personal contact since the divorce. Then Grant had phoned her with a question about a wedding gift for Andrew and Courtney. He'd been friendly and relaxed. And this week, he'd asked her to dinner.</p> <p>Dinner. She and Grant. After six years?</p> <p>She'd heard from Annie that his marriage to Tiffany had ended in divorce the previous year&#x2014;after a brief separation&#x2014;and felt genuinely sorry for him. This was a second divorce for Tiffany, as well. In fact, Bethanne had briefly dated Paul, Tiffany's first husband, shortly after the divorce, although <em>date</em> wasn't exactly the right word. They'd been more of a two-person support group, helping each other grapple with their betrayal by the people they loved. Unfortunately, Andrew's relationship with his father remained cool. Her son had met his father's desertion with a bitter resolve that only seemed to harden as he grew older. Andrew was polite but kept an emotional distance from Grant.</p> <p>For Annie, sixteen at the time, the divorce had been nothing short of devastating. Always a "daddy's girl," she'd acted out her shock and pain as only a willful teenager can. Annie blamed Tiffany for stealing her father away and had done everything she could to sabotage the marriage. But Bethanne was also a target for her rage during those early months. Annie had railed at her for being too "boring" and "clueless" to keep her father happy. Bethanne had never responded to Annie's accusations about her failures as a wife, afraid to reveal how close to home her words had hit. Eventually, Annie had adjusted to the new reality, although she still referred to Grant's second wife in sarcastic tones as "the <em>lovely</em> Tiffany."</p> <p>Bethanne thought about her conversation with him that morning. His excuse for calling this time was so flimsy Bethanne couldn't even remember what it was. He'd kept her on the line, relating office gossip as if she was still intimately familiar with the goings-on at his workplace. After several minutes of chatter, he reminded her that she hadn't given him a definite answer regarding his dinner invitation.</p> <p>"Grant," she'd said bluntly. "Why are you doing this?"</p> <p>For a moment there was silence on the other end. When he spoke, any hints of lightheartedness were gone. "I made a mistake, Bethanne." His voice caught, and for once he seemed at a loss for words. "A major one." He left the rest unsaid, but she knew what he meant. He wanted things back the way they used to be.</p> <p>Well, good luck with that. Bethanne wasn't the same naive woman he'd divorced, and she wasn't interested in retracing her steps.</p> <p>After six years on her own, she'd discovered she didn't want or need a man complicating her life. Years ago she'd read somewhere that "it takes a hell of a man to replace no man." At first, that remark had seemed merely humorous; she hadn't completely understood what it meant. She did now.</p> <p>While she was flattered that Grant wanted to reconcile, the situation wasn't that simple. He'd had his chance. <em>He</em> was the one who'd deserted <em>her,</em> who'd left her floundering and shaken. Without ever thinking about the consequences of his actions, he'd ripped apart their family, betrayed her and their children, robbed them all of their security.</p> <p>Now he was sorry. Fine. He'd seen the error of his ways and realized what a terrible mistake he'd made.</p> <p>So of course he wanted her back. She was a successful businesswoman with a growing company that received lots of media and corporate interest. In six short years she'd made a name for herself. She'd been interviewed by <em>Forbes</em> and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. A piece had been written about her in <em>USA Today</em>. Her ex had his nerve.</p> <p>Contrition was all well and good. Bethanne felt a certain vindication in hearing Grant admit how wrong he'd been, a certain sense of righteousness. She'd forgiven him to the best of her ability, refusing to let herself be trapped in the mire of resentment. He had a new life and so did she. But forgiveness, she'd learned, was tricky. Just when she felt sure she was beyond rancor, she'd find herself wallowing in indignation. Like the night three years ago when the pipe burst in the basement and she couldn't figure out where to turn off the water. If Grant had been there he would've known what to do. By the time she found the tap she'd been shaking with anger, and as unreasonable as it seemed, she'd blamed Grant. This was all <em>his</em> fault. He should've been there. How dared he do this to her and, worse, to their children!</p> <p>She should reject his invitation, she told herself now. Laugh in his face. Tell him to take a hike.</p> <p>To her astonishment she couldn't.</p> <p>It had taken courage for Grant to approach her, courage and, yes, nerve. She'd give him that. Crazy though it might be, Bethanne realized she still had feelings for Grant, feelings she'd pushed aside for the past few years. She didn't love him, not in the all-consuming way she had when they were married. Back then, she'd been blind to his flaws and his weaknesses, blind to what should've been obvious, especially after he'd started the affair. His betrayal had revealed that the man she'd married was selfish and shallow. And yet he hadn't <em>always</em> been like that. She couldn't forget the companionship&#x2014;and the passion&#x2014;of their early years together....</p> <p>She loved him.</p> <p>She hated him.</p> <p>Both emotions warred within her.</p> <p>"Dinner for old times' sake," he'd almost pleaded. "Besides, we need to talk about Andrew's wedding."</p> <p>Six years ago Bethanne had been desperate for him to come home. Her pride was gone. What she'd craved was exactly what Grant wanted now&#x2014;for everything to go back to the way it had been. At the time she'd believed she could fix whatever was wrong. They'd been happy, and could be again.</p> <p>When it became apparent that his affair with Tiffany wasn't a fling and Grant fully intended to go through with the divorce, an all-consuming rage had taken root. She couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. At night she lay awake plotting revenge. One day Grant would be sorry. He'd beg her to take him back and she'd laugh in his face. He would pay for what he'd done.</p> <p>Then, several months after the divorce was finalized, she woke with that familiar ugly feeling in the pit of her stomach and realized this corrosive, soul-destroying bitterness couldn't continue. As the saying had it, the best revenge was living well&#x2014;living a successful, independent life. So Bethanne had dedicated herself to her business.</p> <p>Gradually, she'd stopped thinking about Grant. She embraced her new life, her new identity. Indirectly, she had Grant to thank for her flourishing business, her circle of loyal new friends, for the strength and confidence she'd never known she had. It felt odd to her now that she'd once been content to be simply Grant's wife, looking after his social affairs and staying in the background.</p> <p>Dinner for old times' sake? Just the two of them?</p> <p>In the years since the divorce, Bethanne had dated a number of men. Besides Tiffany's ex, a couple of them stood out in her mind. But she'd been so focused on building her business that neither relationship had lasted more than six months. She wasn't ready or willing to make a serious commitment to anyone. Those relationships, albeit short, had boosted her depleted ego. She'd enjoyed them but she wasn't looking for a long-term commitment.</p> <p>Bethanne had concluded their phone call without giving Grant an answer. She needed to ponder her ex-husband's newfound contrition, and there was no more effective way of doing that than knitting. It was both productive and contemplative; you created something while you meditated on your problems. That was why she'd stopped at Lydia's&#x2014;to pick up yarn for the elegant fingerless gloves she'd make for Courtney's wedding.</p> <p>Lydia glanced up from the display she was working on and smiled when Bethanne entered the store. "You got my message! The cashmere yarn's in."</p> <p>Bethanne smiled back. "I can hardly wait to get started." Knitting had seen her through the darkest days of her life. Annie was the one who'd signed her up for classes, because even dialing the phone number for the yarn store was more than she could manage back then; the smallest tasks had seemed insurmountable. In retrospect, Bethanne knew she'd fallen into a dangerous depression.</p> <p>Annie had enrolled Bethanne in a beginners' sock-knitting class. Meeting the other women had been a turning point for her. Her new friends gave her courage and the determination to emerge from her ordeal a stronger woman. Not only that, it was through the knitting class that she'd met Elise, and through Elise, Maverick. He'd ended up being the "angel" who'd helped her launch Parties. Her classmates had reminded Bethanne that she wasn't alone, rebuilding her confidence one stitch at a time.</p> <p>That class was the beginning of Bethanne's new life. And Part Two turned out to be better than Part One had ever been. Was it possible to knit the two halves together again? Did she want to?</p> <p>"The pattern isn't difficult," Lydia told her as she brought the yarn to the cash register. "Once you do a couple of repeats, I'm sure you won't have a problem, but if you do, just stop by and I'll help you figure it out."</p> <p>Bethanne paid for the purchase, grateful that Lydia had wound the yarn, saving her the effo...</p></p><h2>Compared to Who?: A Proven Path to Improve Your Body Image</h2><p>Have you tried the diets, exercise programs, and self-help rituals, but still feel stuck when it comes to your body image?

None of these sentiments ever helped me at all. I longed for some truth yet couldn&#39;t find it. My prayer is that this book will offer women a completely different perspective on the issue of body image and what&#39;s at the root of it. I pray you&#39;ll read it and be changed for the better!Are you tired of clichs like &#34;It&#39;s what&#39;s on the inside that counts!&#34; or &#34;Just love your body!&#34; which sound encouraging but don&#39;t really help your struggle? Then &#34;Compared to Who?&#34; is for you. It may not be grammatically correct, but it&#39;s one question every woman should ask as she wrestles issues like: Am I enough? Should I try to be more beautiful? Will anyone ever love me? Would my life be different if I looked different? Writing from her personal battle with weight and appearance, Heather will encourage you to see your body image struggles from a fresh perspective. Heather&#39;s humor and honesty will encourage you, while her practical, grace-based approach will offer a path to follow to find the freedom you crave.</p><h2>Manga Mutiny</h2><p><i>Manga Mutiny </i>is a Biblically-accurate retelling of Genesis through Exodus 15:27 presented in the authentic Japanese Manga style.

She's mad at Angeline, the most popular<br>and prettiest girl in the world (or at least in Mackerel Middle School).<br>Jamie is mad at the fact that she has to go to middle school in the first<br>place. She's mad at her disapproving parents, and mad at Hudson Rivers (the<br>eighth cutest guy in her grade) for not noticing her. Her only hope is to<br>console in her diary, the one place where she can spill her heart out and<br>draw pictures of how things really look.<br><br>"Dear Dumb Diary" (Scholastic, $4.99) by Jim Benton is a look at Jamie's<br>life in her own words. Her adventures include avoiding trouble (or getting<br>into it) with her partner in crime, Isabella; rating people on a "Loser"<br>scale; dealing with crazy cafeteria monitor Miss Bruntford; and observing<br>and caring for her dog Stinker.<br><br>You'll laugh out loud at what this girl has to say.<br>From Our Editors The Barnes &amp; Noble Review<br>The hilarious author of the Franny K. Stein, Mad Scientist books zaps fans with another new series, this time about a girl braving the trials and tribulations of middle school. Told in knee-slapping diary entries, the first installment of Jamie Kelly's tales begins as "the worst thing that can happen to you in middle school" almost occurs: getting a nasty nickname (for all of you uneducated souls out there). From there, Jamie goes on to describe a schoolmate's misfortune of using ChocoMint lip smacker; her interest in almost-hunk boy Hudson Rivers; and most of all her unkind feelings toward Angeline, a pretty blonde girl who Jamie's sure is "scorpion-like" beneath her sweet exterior. But when a mysterious culprit smacks the school's cafeteria monitor in her "neck blubber" with meatloaf, Jamie takes the heat and winds up almost-pals with Angeline. Jim Benton delivers a wonderfully silly series that combines his knack for knowing what kids love to read with fun illustrations. Young audiences will eat up Jamie's diary descriptions of stealing Angeline's hair out of the wastebasket, her "glazed" cousin, and just about every other crazy event that happens, while parents are sure to see their kids beg for more Dumb Diary books. As the subtitle suggests, we can pretend this never happened, but in reality we're sure happy it did.

As a leading academic, his work was well documented in scientific circles.</b></p> <br><p>Few made as much use of this fact as Louis Pasteur, who based much of his career on plagiarising and distorting B�champ&#x2019;s research. In doing so, Pasteur secured for himself an undeserved place in the history of medical science. <i>The Blood and its Third Element</i> is B�champ&#x2019;s explanation of his position, and his defense of it against Pasteur&#x2019;s deceptions. </p> <p> This final major work of B�champ&#x2019;s embodies the culmination of his life&#x2019;s research. This book contains, in detail, the elements of the microzymian theory of the organization of living organisms and organic materials. It has immediate and far reaching relevance to the fields of immunology, bacteriology, and cellular biology; and it shows that more than 100 years ago, the germ, or microbian, theory of disease was demonstrated by B�champ to be without foundation. </p> <p><b><b>Reviews</b></b></p> <p>"I am LOVING this book! I thought when starting class "Oh great, a hard book to read" but it has totally surprised me, and I am now having a hard time putting it down! Great read for any one just looking to learn more about the body and blood and how things work..."</p> <p>"This is an excellent book for knowledge seekers who do not take anything at face value. It is not an easy-read book but if you take the time to read and re-read you will gain valuable information that can strengthen your knowledge about the human body and all its elements especially the blood. I highly recommend this book for those wishing to expand their health related knowledge base"</p> <p>"...what Dr. B�champ is describing is a foundational concept. According to his experiments and observations, these tiny particles he named "microzymas" have an active role in sustaining and also in terminating life. Using the syllable "-zyme" (now also used in the word "enzyme") to indicate this principle of causing 'fermentation' (activity) B�champ searched for and found the same particles and activity even in limestone, apparently from the ancient shelled creatures whose bodies were incorporated into the stone. They still retained their activity"</p> <p>"Best book I've ever read on the fundamental elements of life.

Determined to redress this imbalance, Willis examined everything from vintage ladies&#x2019; journals to black newspapers, and started what would become a lifelong quest. With more than two hundred arresting images, many previously unpublished, <em>Posing Beauty</em> recovers a world many never knew existed. Historical subjects such as Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker illuminate the past; Angela Davis and Muhammad Ali take us to the civil rights era; Denzel Washington, Lil&#x2019; Kim, and Michelle Obama celebrate the present. Featuring the works of more than one hundred photographers, including Carl van Vechten, Eve Arnold, Lee Friedlander, and Carrie Mae Weems, Willis&#x2019;s book not only celebrates the lives of the famous but also captures the barber shop, the bodybuilding contest, and prom night. <em>Posing Beauty</em> challenges our most fundamental assumptions about what it means to be &#x201c;beautiful.&#x201d;<br> 242 duotone photographs; 40 pages of five-color photographs</p><p>Deborah Willis, a MacArthur, Guggenheim, and Fletcher Fellow, is the author of Reflections in Black, Posing Beauty, Michelle Obama: The First Lady in Photographs, and the New York Times bestseller Obama: The Historic Campaign in Photographs. She is chair of the photography department and a University Professor at New York University.Willis (<i>Reflections in Black</i>), a MacArthur fellow and chair of New York University's photography department, curates a collection of iconic portraits and snapshots by anonymous photographers in a history of beauty that merges gender, race, family, class. Willis's words, a distillation of her inquiries into beauty and race, are few&#x2014;the images speak for themselves. The photographs, organized thematically, reach back to the 1890s and forward to the current first family. Famous photographers share perspective with family photographers and those known only as Unidentified Photographer. The recognizably famous&#x2014;James Baldwin, Marian Anderson, Joe Louis&#x2014;appear along with those known only as Mom and Friend, Two women holding magazine, ca. 1950s or Barber cutting man's hair outdoors, ca. 1930s. Willis's content is groundbreaking; rarely, for example, are men this adequately represented in a work devoted to beauty within black culture. For Willis, this extraordinary compilation is the culmination of my exploration of beauty within black culture and through the medium of photography. For readers, this is a dazzling eye-opener. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In sheer daemonic strangeness and fertility of conception, Smith is perhaps unexcelled by any other writer.&#x201d;<br> H. P. Lovecraft<br><br>Clark Ashton Smith, considered one of the greatest contributors to seminal pulp magazines such as <i>Weird Tales</i>, helped define and shape weird fiction&#x201d; in the early twentieth century, alongside contemporaries H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, drawing upon his background in poetry to convey an unparalleled richness of imagination and expression in his stories of the bizarre and fantastical.<br><br><i>The Collected Fantasies</i> series presents all of Smith&#x2019;s fiction chronologically. Authorized by the author&#x2019;s estate and endorsed by Arkham House, the stories in this series are accompanied by detailed background notes from editors Scott Connors and Ron Hilger, who in preparation for this collection meticulously compared original manuscripts, various typescripts, published editions, and Smith&#x2019;s own notes and letters. Their efforts have resulted in the most definitive and complete collection of the author&#x2019;s work to date.<br><br><i>The End of the Story</i> is the first of five volumes collecting all of Clark Ashton Smith&#x2019;s tales of fantasy, horror, and science fiction. It includes all of his stories from The Abominations of Yondo&#x201d; (1925) to A Voyage to Sfanomo�&#x201d; (1930) and an introduction by Ramsey Campbell.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, under our Night Shade and Talos imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of titles for readers interested in science fiction (space opera, time travel, hard SF, alien invasion, near-future dystopia), fantasy (grimdark, sword and sorcery, contemporary urban fantasy, steampunk, alternative history), and horror (zombies, vampires, and the occult and supernatural), and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, a national bestseller, or a Hugo or Nebula award-winner, we are committed to publishing quality books from a diverse group of authors.</p><p><b>Clark Ashton Smith</b> was a self-educated poet and author best remembered for his short stories of fantasy, horror, and the supernatural published in genre pulp magazines such as <i>Wonder Stories</i> and <i>Weird Tales</i> in the late 1920s and 1930s. Smith died in 1961 in California.The colorfully exotic tales of Clark Ashton Smith belong to an era of speculative fiction when embellished, purple prose was de rigueur and <i>Weird Tales</i> was a fan-favorite magazine. Despite its ironic title, this inaugural volume in a plan to collect Smith's complete oeuvre begins with the first tale he published (in 1926), "The Abomination of Yondo," and proceeds in roughly chronological order. Smith's tales brim with such familiar gothic tropes as haunted woods, medieval castles, and nightmarish fates for their hapless protagonists. "The Ninth Skeleton," for instance, follows the grisly trail of a young romantic who stumbles on an ancient cemetery before meeting his beloved. Smith's imaginative palette also included primitive science fiction, such as "A Voyage to Sfanomoe," involving a space flight by two brothers fleeing a sinking Atlantis. While Smith's scenarios are at times laughably outdated, his lush, poetic style and vivid characters keep his fiction consistantly entertaining. Essential reading for horror fans and a welcome revival of an often overlooked gothic master. <i>Carl Hays</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The illustrated story is supplemented by a natural and cultural history of hummingbirds, as well as an inspiring message from Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai. The evocative artwork by internationally renowned Haida artist Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas complements this optimistic tale that encourages everyone to take responsibility for their home and the planet.</p><p><b>Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas</b> challenges native stereotypes through illustrative story telling. His artwork is informed by many years of dedication to public service and political activism, mostly on behalf of the Haida.<br><br>Yahgulanaas creates pop-graphic narratives that riff on traditional Haida stories and painting techniques, and developed "Haida Manga" the distinctive art form for which he is widely known. A trickster-like sense of humour contributes to his work&#x2019;s appeal. Yahgulanaas&#x2019; books include <i>Flight of the Hummingbird</i>, <i>A Tale of Two Shamans</i>, <i>The Last Voyage of the Black Ship</i>, <i>Hachidori</i>, and most recently <i>RED</i>, a graphic novel published by Douglas &amp; McIntyre.<br><br>Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas has exhibited in several major galleries, including the Bill Reid Gallery, the McMichael Gallery, the Museum of Anthropology, the Glenbow Museum, and the National Arts Center in Ottawa. His Haida Anime Flight of the Hummingbird&#x201d; is featured on YouTube. For the past two decades, besides developing his unique visual style, Yahgulanaas has spent most of his time working with other Haida people to prevent their homeland, Haida Gwaii, from being logged.<br><br><b>Wangari Muta Maathai</b> was born in Nyeri, Kenya, in 1940, the daughter of farmers in the highlands of Mount Kenya. She is the founder of the Green Belt Movement, which, through networks of rural women, has planted over thirty million trees across Kenya since 1977. In 1986 the Movement established a Pan African Green Belt Network, which has taught people from other African countries the Green Belt Movement&#x2019;s approach to environmental conservation and community building. Several African countries have since started similar successful initiatives.K-Gr 3&#x2013;Based on a South American indigenous story, this book tells of a forest fire that causes the animals to flee for their lives. All except Little Hummingbird, that is, who begins ferrying single drops of water from a nearby stream to the forest. As she works steadfastly to douse the flames, one by one the animals cry out their reasons for running away. Finally Big Bear asks, &#x201c;Little Hummingbird, what are you doing?&#x201d; and she replies, &#x201c;I am doing everything I can.&#x201d; This fablelike tale shows readers how one person can make a difference in everyday life. It will resonate with children and provide a jumping-off point for discussions about how change happens. The illustrations are monochromatic and beautifully representative of Native Haida art. The motif continues onto the endpapers in a stunning black and gray pattern that is both dramatic and satisfying. The author includes back matter on the place of hummingbirds in legend and in an afterword, Nobel Prize-winner Wangari Maathai offers insight into the importance of the individual.<i>Joan Kindig, James Madison University, Harrisonburg, VA</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

So when Meltzer got his hooks in me by the end of page three, and never stopped reeling me in, I have to say I was impressed. I was also impressed that the hero of <em>The Fifth Assassin</em> (first introduced in <em>The Inner Circle</em>) isn&#x2019;t a misanthrope cop or hard-drinking PI but a brainy archivist at the National Archives. Beecher White is a glorified <em>librarian</em>, for god's sake. But with a dash of Sherlock Holmes and a hint of Indiana Jones, White is a refreshingly quirky pursuer of justice, and his hunt for a would-be assassin&#x2014;which takes us through history and through the secret spaces around Washington, DC&#x2014;makes for a thrilling read, as well as a nice reminder that a page-turner can be smart, deeply researched, and just plain fun. --<em>Neal Thompson</em>Brad Meltzer is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Inner Circle</i>, <i>The Book of Fate</i>, and seven other bestselling thrillers.

She&#x2019;d sit at the table in silent protest, hide uneaten toast in her bedroom, listen to parental threats that she&#x2019;d have to eat it for breakfast. But in any life, a set of circumstances can collide, and normal behavior can soon shade into something sinister, something deadly.<br> <br><i>Lighter Than My Shadow </i>is a hand-drawn story of struggle and recovery, a trip into the black heart of a taboo illness, an exposure of those who are so weak that they prey on the weak, and an inspiration to anybody who believes in the human power to endure and to eventually find happiness.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of October 2017:</strong> A vast number of thoughtful books about mental illness and eating disorders already exist, so it seems almost impossible that a new story could add anything more to the genus. But Katie Green does exactly that with her astonishing graphic memoir that reveals through every delicate squiggle the long-lingering anguish people in recovery live through while friends and family assume that everything is now A-OK. A normal child growing up among a normal family, Katie develops bulimia as a teen, eventually requiring hospitalization, and she is pulled from school while she learns to eat again. An alternative treatment therapist helps pull Katie through her rough spots, but as Katie discovers once she&#x2019;s older, his therapy was not completely benign. Artist and storyteller Green exposes buried-deep emotions through the slope of a shoulder or the slightly-too-big distance between her characters in a way that can&#x2019;t be mimicked through words. The impact of Katie&#x2019;s loneliness and constant, low-level despair drives deep into the soul but paradoxically will open your own heart and eyes. You&#x2019;ll finish this determined to look more closely at your friends and loved ones&#x2014;and especially your children&#x2014;to make sure you&#x2019;re not missing what&#x2019;s masked by a benign surface. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review </em><p>Katie Green is an artist and illustrator living in the south west of England.�&nbsp;She studied for a degree in biology before specialising in illustration and going on to create Lighter Than My Shadow, which is her first book.</p> <p> She publishes a bi-monthly zine, The Green Bean, and shares snippets of her other projects on her website, www.katiegreen.co.uk</p></p><h2>Rich Dad&#39;s Prophecy: Why the Biggest Stock Market Crash in History Is Still Coming...And How You Can Prepare Yourself and Profit from It!</h2><p><br>The rich know that times of greatest crisis are often the greatest opportunities to acquire wealth. In this book Robert Kiyosaki teaches how to build your financial ark to navigate turbulent economic waters. In hindsight, the title itself seems "prophetic," as the insights and predictions in this book have played out on the world stage over the past years. Rich Dad's Prophecy will open your eyes to the issues that are affecting the retirement plans of baby boomers as well as the financial futures of their children and grandchildren.</p><p>Robert Kiyosaki founded an international financial education company and invented the board game Cashflow. Sharon Lechter is an accountant who now focuses her efforts on creating educational tools for anyone wishing to better their financial education.The premise of the authors' advice is that the demand for stocks will drop like a rock when the Baby Boomer generation retires and starts liquidating their portfolios to pay for living expenses. The 401 (k) retirement plan Congress passed REQUIRES that participants begin withdrawing funds from such accounts when they reach age 701�2, which for a large number of them will occur around the year 2016. The broader message that Kiyosaki teaches better than anyone is that only YOU can prepare for your retirement by anticipating such drastic market forces and staying vigilant about other opportunities for making money.

Anita Hemmings smiled at two freshman girls who looked at once delighted and struck by nerves, and walked down the steps to collect her suitcases. Her trunk had been sent ahead and would be waiting for her in the school&#x2019;s congested luggage room, then brought up to her quarters by a porter.<br> <br>The New York town of Poughkeepsie had boasted a trolley only since 1894. In her freshman year, Anita had arrived with her cases in a shaky horse-drawn tram, dusty and soot-colored, and painted with the words HUDSON RIVER R.R. DEPOT and a large gold number four. But for the past three years, Vassar students had pulled up in the efficient trolley, and she couldn&#x2019;t think of a better way to approach the Lodge, the handsome, red-brick gatehouse that served as the campus&#x2019;s entrance and guard post. Anita glanced up at the clock atop its simple fa�ade, centered above four long windows. It was almost five o&#x2019;clock. She had left Boston at just past seven in the morning and hadn&#x2019;t encountered any other Vassar girl until she changed trains in Albany. Now she was just steps away from her favorite sliver of the world, the college where she would reside for one more year.<br> <br>Anita had never lived in a building that could be described as handsome until she went off to school, first in Massachusetts&#x2019;s Pioneer Valley, then at Vassar. Her hometown of Boston was crowded with elegant structures: stately brick houses you could stroll past, imagining the favored lives transpiring inside. But she had never had more than a glimpse of their sumptuous interiors. Here, on the vast expanse of land Vassar occupied a few miles from the gently curving Hudson River, every inch was hers&#x2014;shared with 522 other girls, but still hers.<br> <br>In Boston&#x2019;s Roxbury neighborhood, Anita, the oldest of four, shared a small, red-brick row house with her parents; her brothers, Frederick and Robert; and her sister, Elizabeth. It was indistinguishable from its squat neighbors, with a roof that leaked and too few rooms for six. She knew every vein of Roxbury, every needy character in the quarter, and was keenly aware that her friends at Vassar had not grown up in such a place.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that Anita Hemmings?&#x201d;<br> <br>At the sound of her name, she turned to see the alabaster face of Caroline Hyde Hardin. The puffs of Caroline&#x2019;s dress sleeves were bigger than last year&#x2019;s, and she wore the trumpet-shaped, S-curved skirt that had become even more in vogue over the summer. Anita fretted for a moment over her travel-weary appearance, but her tension vanished as she was enveloped in a welcoming hug.<br> <br>&#x201c;Caroline!&#x201d; she exclaimed, as her friend stepped back and wiped strands of red hair from her face. It was September 18, but the day was thick with the dense heat of a mid-July afternoon.<br> <br>&#x201c;I could tell it was you,&#x201d; said Caroline. &#x201c;You walk so elegantly, even when you&#x2019;re laden down. Where is Mervis to help us?&#x201d; she said, looking around for the porter everyone preferred.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s just assisting with the trunks of a few other girls who came on the earlier trains. He&#x2019;ll be back down,&#x201d; Anita said, smoothing her light summer dress and taking Caroline&#x2019;s hand, unable to hide her pleasure at being back on campus. &#x201c;Oh, how I missed this beautiful place,&#x201d; she said, nodding toward the ivy-clad, Renwick-designed Main Building.<br> <br>The circle in front of Main was crowded with carriages, tired horses, and girls bidding their families goodbye while vying for help with their boxes and suitcases. Before Anita and Caroline had arrived at Vassar as freshmen in 1893, Main had a regal entry with a double staircase leading to an impressive second-floor door, but a long annex had been added to the center of the building that year, courtesy of the school&#x2019;s favorite trustee, Frederick Ferris Thompson. The students called it Uncle Fred&#x2019;s Nose or the Soap Box, for its ample use of white marble. It now housed the ever-expanding library, where the students spent many an evening trying to push to the top of their class.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s enormous, but it does look smaller every year, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; said Anita. &#x201c;Perhaps because we&#x2019;ve become more comfortable here.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was right on both counts. The building, built to mimic the Tuileries Palace in Paris, was monumental in size, with five floors crisscrossed by halls twelve feet wide and almost two hundred yards long. On the roof were six thousand feet of lightning rods to help prevent the incessant threat of fire.<br> <br>Caroline and Anita headed inside and were greeted by a chorus of delighted voices.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where did you spend your summer, Anita?&#x201d; Caroline asked before they were both absorbed into the feminine gaggle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nowhere exotic, I&#x2019;m afraid. I was just home in Boston and then on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard again. My usual summer holiday in charming Cottage City. At home I tutored Greek to several girls preparing for Vassar&#x2019;s entrance exam. I hope some will be freshmen next year, though I believe a proficiency in Greek and Latin is less important than it used to be.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that refreshing to hear? I am wretched at Greek. That class on Thucydides and Pausanias last spring tied my brain into knots, though not yours.&#x201d; Caroline spread her arms as if she were about to clutch the building and let them drop when several families saying farewell to their freshmen moved by.<br> <br>&#x201c;Were you back in the Middle East, Caroline?&#x201d; Anita asked, fixing her grip on her small bag.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, yes,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;For most of the summer I was in Syria, then we spent some time exploring Italy and France. I wanted to spend more time in Venice, which is just the most enchanting place on earth, a world floating on water, but Father had me working in his school for most of June and July. Lessons in Christianity, lessons in biology, lessons in just about everything. But August was so dreadfully hot that we had to leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>Caroline&#x2019;s father ran a large school in Syria, and she had an abundance of captivating stories about her childhood there. Anita had been nowhere but the American Northeast and clung to Caroline&#x2019;s tales as if they were Scheherazade&#x2019;s.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you rooming with Elise Monroe again, Anita?&#x201d; asked Caroline, waving to a friend who had just entered the building.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, didn&#x2019;t you hear? She&#x2019;s left school to be married.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Has she!&#x201d; said Caroline, her attention fully on Anita. &#x201c;Is she marrying the Browning boy? The one who was such a star at Yale?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The very one. He&#x2019;s from Washington, and they&#x2019;re to be married there just before Thanksgiving.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Congratulations to the soon-to-be Mrs. Browning, then. Though it&#x2019;s sad that her parents didn&#x2019;t let her finish up one more year here. She was so strong in drama. Such a knack for comedic delivery. I&#x2019;ll miss her in the hall plays.&#x201d;<br> <br>Anita nodded in agreement and the friends meandered through Main, heading up to the senior hall on what everyone called the third floor, though it was the fourth story of the building, a floor above where they had roomed the year before. They took the stairs, as the elevator had a line down the hall.<br> <br>&#x201c;If Elise is gone, then who is your roommate this year?&#x201d; asked Caroline, taking a piece of paper from her case with her room number on it. &#x201c;Or do you have a single, too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m rooming with Louise Taylor, from New York.&#x201d;<br> <br>Caroline looked at Anita with surprise. &#x201c;Louise Taylor! As in Lottie Taylor? I never thought she would be short a roommate. How did that happen? Isn&#x2019;t she rooming with Dora Fairchild again? They have for two years now. They&#x2019;re awfully close.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dora stayed on in London, it seems, after her summer travels,&#x201d; said Anita. &#x201c;Much to the shock and disappointment of Lottie. Kendrick informed me of everything just a few weeks ago. I thought I might be placed in a single in Strong Hall, but I don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve already communicated with Kendrick? Aren&#x2019;t you the lucky one,&#x201d; said Caroline of their admired lady principal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you know Louise well?&#x201d; Anita asked, trying to catch her breath after the climb.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lottie?&#x201d; said Caroline, in a suddenly serious voice. &#x201c;I would say we&#x2019;re friends, even close friends, but in truth I know her just like everyone knows her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Anita looked questioningly at her classmate, hoping she would say more.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I know of her money and her palatial house in New York,&#x201d; said Caroline, picking up on Anita&#x2019;s curiosity. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s right near the Vanderbilts&#x2019; on Fifth Avenue, you know. Of course you do. It was the talk freshman year. She&#x2019;s also very close to the Rockefellers. Bessie Rockefeller Strong, who was a special student here in the eighties and is Mr. Rockefeller&#x2019;s eldest, is a mentor to her. Or so they say. Bessie is the one who suggested Vassar to Clarence Taylor, Lottie&#x2019;s father. Lottie is also friendly with Consuelo Vanderbilt. She was a guest at her wedding last year to the Duke of Marlborough. You know, the one held at St. Thomas&#x2019; Church that the papers made such a fuss about.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked at her friend to see if she was still listening and saw Anita&#x2019;s eyes were wide with fascination.<br> <br>&#x201c;You saw the pictures, I&#x2019;m sure. The New York Times even ran that ridiculous piece on the luxury of her trousseau, paying particular attention to her intimate wears. I don&#x2019;t think the whole of America needed to read about the lace on her ivory corset covers, though it was all quite an affair. People lined up for days in front of St. Thomas&#x2019; to get a glimpse of her. Consuelo and her swanlike neck. Not Lottie. She was inside the church along with her parents and her very handsome brother, now up at Harvard. A towhead like her. He&#x2019;s been on campus before. Younger, but not young enough for it to matter. So I know quite a bit about that, and I know the rumors of what happened between Lottie and Lewis Van de Graff, of the Philadelphia Van de Graffs, at Harvard last year. Everyone here says she&#x2019;s very fast. But I don&#x2019;t really know her as a best friend would, though I&#x2019;d like to. We&#x2019;re both in Philaletheis, though I&#x2019;m Chapter Beta and she&#x2019;s Chapter Theta.&#x201d;<br> <br>Caroline put her hand on the wooden rail and exhaled loudly, as if she was surprised by her own knowledge of Lottie Taylor. Caroline and Lottie had been members of Philaletheis together for three years, the college&#x2019;s exclusive dramatic society and oldest club, but rooming with a woman once described as a speeding locomotive with hair by the Harvard senior class president was another thing entirely.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you two will get on,&#x201d; she concluded. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just . . . quite a girl. Yes, that&#x2019;s a good way to put it. She&#x2019;s quite a girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>Anita had known that Lottie&#x2019;s family was well-off but could not visualize to what extent. Caroline uttering Lottie&#x2019;s name in the same breath as John Rockefeller&#x2014;who had funded the school&#x2019;s first separate dormitory and was funding a new academic building to break ground that year&#x2014;was constricting her breathing even further. And then there was Consuelo Vanderbilt. All the Vassar girls followed her doings, but Caroline had said Lottie actually attended her wedding. Anita&#x2019;s starched traveling dress suddenly felt very tight. She put down her bag and reached up to loosen the stiff lace collar.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anita, are you unwell?&#x201d; asked Caroline.<br> <br>Anita flushed in embarrassment and bent to pick up her things. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what came over me. It must be this awful heat. I feel a bit faint.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come, let&#x2019;s walk down to senior hall and get settled in,&#x201d; said Caroline, taking her arm. &#x201c;Those stairs were dreadful. One of the maids can fetch you something cool to drink. Of course it&#x2019;s the heat. They need to open some of these windows and circulate the air.&#x201d; Caroline said as much to one of the young maids, and the two moved away from the other girls still greeting one another as if they&#x2019;d been off fighting a war, rather than just separated by a summer vacation.<br> <br>As they walked to the seniors&#x2019; area, Anita thought about her idiocy in agreeing to share rooms with Lottie Taylor. She didn&#x2019;t want to be housed with anyone prominent, anyone who might attract attention. She needed a nobody from nowhere so she could keep walking quietly through the crowd of Vassar women, well liked, but not too well liked; active in school, but not president of any esteemed club; smart enough, but not first in her class&#x2014;nothing that would make her shine too brightly or fall too hard. She wanted to be smiled at and then quickly forgotten.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here in room eighty-nine,&#x201d; said Caroline, as they reached it. &#x201c;Will you be all right to walk to yours?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me? Oh, yes, I&#x2019;m feeling much better now. Just a quick spell. I&#x2019;m in room twenty-one, right in front of the art gallery,&#x201d; said Anita, pointing down the hall. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you at dinner, Caroline.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re in twenty-one?&#x201d; said Caroline, looking down at the hallway&#x2019;s double marble staircase near Anita&#x2019;s room. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s the very best senior room, with a perfect view of the Lodge. How did you draw that one? Oh, never mind,&#x201d; she said, smiling and opening her door. &#x201c;Lottie Taylor,&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>Caroline was in a single, a bedroom without a parlor, and a less desirable view.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so happy to be back, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Anita said, watching her friend walk into her bright, sparsely furnished room.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am, too, Anita. There&#x2019;s no place I love more.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girls bid each other goodbye, and Anita turned the corner toward her room, opening the oak door with her free hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just leave it by the desk closest to the window, please,&#x201d; she heard a voice say at once. Anita saw Lottie, her back to the door, trying to nail a square of ornate silk fabric above their parlor window.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Anita replied. &#x201c;You must be waiting for your trunk.&#x201d; Lottie turned to look at her with a nail in her mouth and nearly dropped the hammer. She took the nail out and gave her an apologetic smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Anita Hemmings! And you must think me the rudest girl in the world. I&#x2019;m sorry I didn&#x2019;t turn around. I thought you were Mervis with my things.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing at all,&#x201d; Anita said, walking into the already heavily decorated room. &#x201c;I saw Mervis downstairs, but I&#x2019;m afraid he&#x2019;s extremely busy. I&#x2019;m sure our trunks will be brought up soon. Though I think they&#x2019;ll have to be attended to by someone else. Every senior girl in Main seems to be after him.&#x201d; As with most of the accommodations in Main, Anita and Lottie had a set of three rooms with two bedrooms and a large shared parlor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine, fine. I&#x2019;m in no particular rush,&#x201d; said Lottie brightly. &#x201c;I have all the accessories I need to get our parlor in order right here.&#x201d; Both girls looked at the floor of their square room, which was covered in fabrics and paintings.<br> <br>Lottie paused her chatter as she stepped down from her chair. In her white dress, with her blond hair pinned to her head and the dying evening light creating a shadow behind her, she looked as if she had flown down from somewhere much finer, somewhere celestial.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look at you, you&#x2019;re even prettier than everybody said,&#x201d; she pronounced, approaching Anita. &#x201c;I remembered you, of course, but we didn&#x2019;t overlap much in classes, did we? You&#x2019;re very Greek and Latin, I hear. I like Asian history and the sciences.&#x201d; She extended her hand, then held Anita by the shoulders as a mother might do to a child who had just come in...</p><h2>The Goetia: The Lesser Key of Solomon the King: Lemegeton - Clavicula Salomonis Regis, Book 1</h2><p><p>Provides a clear and detailed account of the preparations and precautions necessary for the successful evocation of its 72 spirits, which are described in detail.

Offering insight and advice, the authors guide the &#x201c;targeted&#x201d; parent through the issues and challenges and help them better manage their experiences.</p><p>Amy J.L. Baker, Ph.D., is a nationally recognized leader and expert in the field of parental alienation and loyalty conflicts. She is the author of Adult Children of Parental Alienation Syndrome: Breaking the Ties That Bind (2007) and Working with Alienated Children and Families: A Clinical Guidebook (2012). Baker has published numerous academic articles on the topic of parental alienation and writes a blog for Psychology Today on the topic. She also has an active coaching practice for targeted parents and serves as an expert witness in custody disputes around the country. <br> <br>Paul R. Fine, LCSW, is a licensed clinical social worker in practice in Englewood, NJ, in a community mental health center. He has over 30 years&#x2019; experience providing individual, family, and group psychotherapy to adults, teens, and children. Along with Amy Baker, he is the co-author of a chapter in the recently released Working with Alienated Children and Families: A Clinical Guidebook (2012) and the forthcoming book Co-Parenting with a Toxic Ex: Protecting Your Children from Loyalty Conflicts and Alienation (2013).According to Baker and social worker Fine, 20 percent of divorces are high-conflict, involving frequent visits to court, allegations of abuse, and chronic disagreements regarding parenting schedules. Often resulting in the alienation of one parent, the 'targeted' person loses out on a relationship with his or her child and suffers a great deal of pain and uncertainty. The authors collect some of these heartbreaking stories, put them into their psychological framework, relate them to the academic literature, and finally, offer a last chapter on ideas for maintaining communication. VERDICT This is an important contribution to a rarely visited topic. While aimed at the estranged parent, there is a scholastic curve that makes the text more appropriate for social workers and mediators. That group would also benefit from this text, which is a suitable purchase for academic libraries. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Poignant and heartbreaking, these stories shine a much needed light on the sometimes healing but always tragic journey of targeted parents. This book will help readers, like me, who are dealing with the pain of parental alienation to know that others have traveled this path and have survived. This gives me the strength to forge ahead in my personal journey of hope and healing, and bring others along with me and my foundation Stand Up for Gus. (Jason Patric, actor and targeted father)<br><br>Surviving Parental Alienation: A Journey of Hope and Healing, has given a voice to the hundreds of thousands of parents and grandparents that can only remember their children through memories and photos from days gone by. Amy Baker and Paul Fine have given us yet another piece to unlocking this puzzling form of emotional child abuse. Their continuous contributions to the parental alienation arena are priceless. On behalf of all target parents, we say thank you. You give us strength and the hope that someday our children will come home. (Jill Egizii, president, Parental Alienation Awareness Organization USA)<br><br>This powerful book evokes strong emotions such as anger, grief, compassion, and amazement. Although the personal narratives are from the perspective of alienated parents, we also glimpse the inner experience of alienating parents and their children. Thankfully, Baker and Fine are hopeful that alienated children sometimes find their way back to the parents they shunned for many years. The authors give wise suggestions for alienated parents to consider as they work toward that goal. (William Bernet, M.D., professor emeritus, Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee)<br><br>As a clinician in the field of high conflict divorce, many parents come to me having been told that their story is the worst and most painful case of parental alienation ever seen. In some sense they are right because every story of parental alienation is painful and tragic. At the same time, every story has something to teach the rest of us about this phenomenon of parents and children being ripped apart. In Surviving Parental Alienation: Journeys of Hope and Healing, Baker and Fine honor these stories and in doing so, honor the parents and children who have suffered because of parental alienation. But Baker and Fine do more than simply provide a place for others to tell their stories. They make meaning of the stories. They dig into the phenomenon of parental alienation to provide a deeper understanding of why people find and marry people who will eventually alienate their children from them, how the alienating parents &#x201c;sell&#x201d; the poisonous message to the children, and how &#x2013; sometimes when it seems least likely&#x2013; the alienated children and their lost parents find their way back to each other. This is a moving book and a must read for parents and professionals alike. (S. Richard Sauber, Ph.D., ABPP, Family Forensic Psychologist and editor of The American Journal of Family Therapy)<br><br>An important and powerful book &#x2013; for parents and professionals! <br><br>Baker and Fine have combined tragic stories of children rejecting a parent with a solid analysis of the often-hidden behaviors that lead to such alienation. But most of all, they have included stories of hope and reconciliation (equally including fathers and mothers who have been targets of blame), with effective strategies for parents who want to reach out to their alienated children. <br><br>It would be hard to believe some of these stories (both of loss and of hope) if I hadn&#x2019;t known such similar stories first hand experienced by some of my clients in family court. This book helps show the importance of understanding alienating behaviors and, without focusing on blame, but rather what to do now with many excellent suggestions. <br><br>With personality disorders apparently increasing in society, we will (and already are) seeing more cases of alienated children. This is a problem that is not going away by ignoring it and leaving parents to cope on their own. (Bill Eddy, family lawyer, family therapist, and co-author of Splitting: Protecting Yourself While Divorcing Someone with Borderline Personality Disorder)<br><br>Amy Baker is one of the guiding lights in the field of understanding parental alienation. She has probably done more to bring the topic to public awareness than any other professional. In this new and important book, Baker and Paul Fine write with compassion and wisdom about the struggles of parents who are dealing with the trauma of parental alienation. More importantly, they provide concrete actions that parents can take to improve their situation and to heal themselves. I highly recommend this book. (Joshua Coleman, Ph.D., author of When Parents Hurt: Compassionate Strategies When You and Your Grown Child Get Along)<br><br>Surviving Parental Alienation is a work that will help reduce the emotional isolation that an alienated parent feels. The authors give the alienated parent hope and reason for not giving up and walking away from the children they love dearly.

Queen Alyss is back on the throne, and reunited with her childhood sweetheart, Dodge. But the fight for Wonderland is far from over. King Arch, in nearby Boarderland, is conniving to overthrow everything for which Alyss and her friends have fought so hard. Even worse, King Arch has found an ally in the recently returned Redd, who has been biding her time and gathering new and evil assassins in the Catacombs of Paris. With enemies circling and danger looming, someone close to Alyss lets her down&#x2014;and threatens the future of Wonderland forever.</p><p>Frank Beddor is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Looking Glass Wars,</i> the young-adult novel that first introduced young readers to the true story of Alyss. He lives in Los Angeles, California.Frank Beddor took a classic story and turned it into a powerful, magical adventure with THE LOOKING GLASS WARS. With Part Two, SEEING REDD, Gerard Doyle once again shows what can be done with just a voice and talent. His cadence, his raw emotion, and his skill bring to life the story of Queen Alyss, who is battling the evil Aunt Redd to keep Wonderland out of her grasp. Doyles enthusiastic performance is reminiscent of Jim Dales work on the Harry Potter series. Clearly, Doyle has made this series his own. Beddors world is one in which the power of imagination is a literal thing. He has plausible explanations for even the most outrageous claims made in Lewis Carrolls book. And youll believe every word.

In fact, Benjamin Graham was Buffett&#39;s professor at Columbia and the most influential financial advisor he ever had. So, have you ever tried reading Graham&#39;s books?

Author: Spirituality &amp; Health</p><h2>The Dhammapada (Easwaran&#39;s Classics of Indian Spirituality Book 3)</h2><p><b>Easwaran&#x2019;s best-selling translation of this classic Buddhist text <i>The Dhammapada</i> is reliable, readable, and profound.</b><br><br> Dhammapada means "the path of dharma," the path of harmony and righteousness that anyone can follow to reach the highest good. The Dhammapada is a collection of verses, gathered probably from direct disciples who wanted to preserve what they had heard from the Buddha himself.<br><br> Easwaran's comprehensive introduction to the Dhammapada gives an overview of the Buddha's teachings that is penetrating, and clear - accessible for readers new to Buddhism, but also with fresh insights and practical applications for readers familiar with this text. His translation is based on the original Pali. Chapter introductions, notes and a Sanskrit glossary place individual verses into the context of the broader Buddhist canon. <br><br> Easwaran is a master storyteller, and the introduction includes many stories that make moving, memorable reading, bringing young Siddhartha and his heroic spiritual quest vividly to life. This faithful interpretation brings us closer to the compassionate heart of the Buddha.</p><p>Eknath Easwaran (1910-1999) brings to this volume a rare combination of credentials. He was trained from an early age in Sanskrit, of which Pali, the language of the Buddha, is a simplified version. Later he studied English literature and was chairman of the English department at a major Indian university when he came to the United States on a Fulbright fellowship in 1959. Huston Smith writes, "His Indian heritage, literary gifts, and spiritual sensibilities here produce a sublime rendering of the words of the Buddha. Verse after verse shimmers with quiet, confident authority."<br><br>In 1961 Easwaran founded the Blue Mountain Center of Meditation in California, and in 1967, at the University of California, Berkeley, he taught the first academic course on meditation ever offered for credit at a major American university. He continued to teach passage meditation and his Eight Point Program for spiritual living to an American and international audience for almost forty years. His twenty-seven books on meditation and the classics of world mysticism are translated into twenty-five languages.<br><br>From the mid 1970s onwards, Easwaran held classes on the Dhammapada for a primarily American audience. A gifted teacher, he was able to anticipate the problems that Western readers may have with the concepts underlying the classics of Indian spirituality, and to explain them in fresh and profoundly simple ways. <br><br>But for Easwaran the Dhammapada was not just of intellectual interest. His main qualification for interpreting the Dhammapada, he said, was that he knew from his own experience that these verses could truly transform our lives.</p><h2>For Black Girls Like Me</h2><p><p><b>In this lyrical coming-of-age story about family, sisterhood, music, race, and identity, Mariama J.

She somehow manages to do this while exploring family mental illness, sibling relationships, moving schools and geographies, and the messiness of pre-adolescence.

Pampered pets, however, are a rarity among animals who have been domesticated. Farm animals, for example, are usually slaughtered before their first birthday. We never stop to think about it, but the typical images we see of cows, chickens, pigs, and the like are of young animals. What would we see if they were allowed to grow old?<br><br> Isa Leshko shows us, brilliantly, with this collection of portraits. To create these portraits, she spent hours with her subjects, gaining their trust and putting them at ease. The resulting images reveal the unique personality of each animal. It&#x2019;s impossible to look away from the animals in these images as they unforgettably meet our gaze, simultaneously calm and challenging. In these photographs we see the cumulative effects of the hardships of industrialized farm life, but also the healing that time can bring, and the dignity that can emerge when farm animals are allowed to age on their own terms.<br><br> Each portrait is accompanied by a brief biographical note about its subject, and the book is rounded out with essays that explore the history of animal photography, the place of beauty in activist art, and much more. &nbsp;Open this book to any page. Meet Teresa, a thirteen-year-old Yorkshire Pig, or Melvin, an eleven-year-old Angora Goat, or Tom, a seven-year-old Broad Breasted White Turkey. You&#x2019;ll never forget them.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Isa Leshko</b> is a photographer who focuses on themes of aging and animal rights. Her images of aging farm animals are much admired and have been published in the <i>Atlantic</i>, <i>Boston Globe, the Guardian</i>, <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i>, <i>the New York Times</i>, and elsewhere."Beautiful, thought-provoking." (<i>The Australian</i>)<br><br>"A poignant creation. . . . one of the things that is so remarkable about the portraits &#x2013; you can see each animal's personality; their singularity and distinction. Each is a beautiful, living individual, not some abstract "thing" produced en masse at a factory for the purpose of fueling humans." (<i>Treehugger</i>)<br><br>"This is partly the story of a woman who starts out not knowing how to open and close a farm gate, and ends up learning how to put animals at ease so she can photograph them in close-up (approach them at eye level; lie in the hay with them for as long as it takes; don&#x2019;t take your bag into the pen, because they&#x2019;ll eat it).&nbsp;It&#x2019;s also about characters like friendly Melvin the Angora goat, and Babs the impossibly stoic, shaggy donkey, who are described in the text with an empathy at times reminiscent of Helen Macdonald&#x2019;s H is for Hawk. Making the text personal makes the book feel warm and open rather than preachy, which seems the right way to go if you really want to &#x2018;start a conversation,&#x2019; as Leshko does.&#x201d; (<i>Observer</i>)<br><br>"Leshko's photography captures animals, living on farm sanctuaries,&nbsp;in their old age&#x2014;something we don't often have the privilege to see. Her stunning images are accompanied by biographies of these beautiful animals, who are presented with dignity and respect."&nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp; (Mayim Bialik)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Leshko&#x2019;s portraits bring to mind Peter Hujar&#x2019;s photographs of animals, which similarly captured the particularity of a dog or horse (or goose or goat), a sense of that creature&#x2019;s individual consciousness. Leshko&#x2019;s photographs, too, are rich in respect and empathy while avoiding sentimentality....Whatever viewers&#x2019; thoughts on animal rights, her pictures give us pause to consider why some are cherished pets and others are disposable.&#x201d;</p> (<i>Photograph</i>)<br><br>"I learned at an early age that animals are complex, thinking, feeling creatures. All animals. So often, though, we overlook the lives of those animals who are raised for farming and meat production. Isa Leshko offers us a deeply personal view into the lives of these animals. Her portraits are tender and present the inescapable fact that each subject is a living thinking creature with an individual history and personality."<br> &nbsp; (Moby)<br><br>"There is great poise and dignity in the animals Isa Leshko captures with her lens: their characters shine brightly despite their often devastating histories. She&nbsp;<i>looks&nbsp;</i>at them, and her gaze reveals them as individuals.&nbsp;One hopes our society looks, too, and does better for them all. What Leshko gives us with these photographs is a reminder of the very real fates of these and all farm animals.&nbsp;I would love to know every one of them."<br> &nbsp; (Alexandra Horowitz, author of Inside of a Dog)<br><br>"It is a pleasure to see these elderly cousins of ours, rheumy-eyed, bewhiskered, unsteady on their feet, enjoying their twilight years in peace, security, and dignity."<br> &nbsp; (J. M. Coetzee)<br><br>"Empathy. Humans have the greatest capacity for it. And we have the greatest need for much, much more of it. In this soulful, deeply conveyed book, extraordinary photos team with eloquent words to show us the wisdom path to becoming more human by becoming more humane." (Carl Safina, author of Beyond Words)<br><br>"In <i>Allowed to Grow Old</i>, Leshko's remarkable, unsentimental photos of older chickens, turkeys, pigs, cows and other animals achieve something that I have not seen before in photos of domesticated animals. We get to know them, not as things to eat or produce milk or eggs for us, but as individuals with personalities and lives of their own to lead."

Against the backdrop of major historical events and movements, the authors examine the issues that changed the roles and lives of women in our society.

She lives in Manhattan and is employed as a newswriter and producer for WOR radio.1<br><br>Founding Mothers<br><br>The fate of the European women who came to the New World in the early days of colonial settlement was a life of nearly ceaseless hard work. Many who came were already accustomed to physical labor. Those who were not quickly adapted. In a totally undeveloped and sparsely populated land, the labor of every able-bodied settler was desperately needed, and women's traditional work--providing food, clothing, shelter, and the rudiments of hygiene--was essential to survival.<br><br>The demands of the New World allowed colonial women more freedom "to do" than was often available to women of later generations. This latitude was the product not of ideology, but of necessity. Colonial society did not support the idea of equality between men and women. European men brought with them to America the tenet that woman was man's inferior. This belief in female inferiority, however, was minimized by the conditions of the New World. So long as the colonies remained relatively undeveloped, women enjoyed a limited kind of independence.<br><br>Women were an integral part of all permanent settlements in the New World. When men traveled alone to America, they came as fortune hunters, adventurers looking for a pot of gold; such single men had no compelling reason to establish communities. Women acted as civilizers for men living alone in the wilderness. Where there were women, there were children who had to be taught. There was a future--a reason to establish laws, towns, churches, schools. The organizers of Virginia understood as much when they sought to attract women to their colony so that the men who came "might be faster tied to Virginia." The labor provided by a wife and children also helped transform the forest into farmland. In the early days of the Georgia settlement the proprietors advertised for male recruits with "industrious wives."<br><br>In many cases women emigrated together with men. Such was the case throughout New England and the middle colonies, where whole families often came in search of religious freedom. Elsewhere, particularly in the South, women had to be lured to America. Some colonies offered women the right to own their own land. Lord Baltimore of Maryland offered 100 acres for a planter, 100 acres for a wife, and 50 for a child. Women heads of families were treated in the same way as men.<br><br>Other less conventional methods were used to encourage female emigration. The British crown, which chartered the majority of settlements, allowed women convicts the option of emigrating to the colonies rather than serving out jail sentences at home. Many female prostitutes and thieves settled in the New World rather than submit to the notorious severity of English criminal "justice." (Daniel Defoe's novel Moll Flanders is about such a woman--a London prostitute transported to America--who makes good.) Many of these women convicts were brought as indentured servants; they were obligated to serve a master for a number of years, without wages, before they were allowed their freedom.<br><br>Marriage was another inducement that encouraged women to come to the New World. Throughout colonial times men outnumbered women by three to one, or more. Women could be assured of finding husbands in America. One eager publicist for Carolina wrote, "If any maid or single woman have desire to go over, they will think themselves in the Golden Age, when men paid a Dowry for their wives; for if they be but civil, and under 50 years of age, some honest man or other will purchase them for their wives."<br><br>In 1619 an enterprising sea captain who had advertised for single women looking to marry transported 144 of them to Virginia. The captain paid for the women's passage and, on arrival, he sold them as "wives" for 120 pounds of fine Virginia tobacco apiece. There are reports of other captains who kidnaped young women off the streets of London rather than going to the trouble of advertising.<br><br>Of the 144 women who emigrated to Virginia in 1619 looking for husbands, only 35 were still alive six years later. Conditions in the New World, particularly for the first settlers, did not encourage long life. The months-long sail across the Atlantic was perilous--epidemics often carried off half or more of the passengers. At the end of the journey, there were new dangers to be faced.What is surprising is not the number of women who died early, but the number who survived. The bravery and stamina of the women in colonial times were renowned. William Byrd described one such woman living in a back settlement of Virginia in 1710, saying she was "a very civil" woman who showed "nothing of ruggedness, or immodesty in her carriage, yet she will carry a gun in the woods and kill deer, turkeys, etc., shoot down wild cattle, catch and tye hogs, knock down beeves with an ax and perform the most manful exercises as well as most men in these parts."<br><br>The lives of colonial women and men tended to center around farm and family. For the most part a traditional division of labor was observed, whereby men did the outside work--planting and harvesting crops--while women worked inside, transforming the raw products into usable commodities.<br><br>All of woman's work on the farm came under the general heading of "housewifery." What it included varied somewhat from region to region. The wives of southern planters rarely did their own weaving and spinning, while in the northern colonies these tasks took up many hours of a woman's day. In the South women tended their own herbal gardens and were expected to be expert at doctoring. White southern women of means were often responsible for the health needs of their slaves as well as those of their own families.<br><br>New England houses were small--one or two rooms and a loft. The houses of southern planters were larger and more lavish. The roughest living was on the frontier, where a house was often a one-room shack, sometimes even a lean-to or wigwam. William Byrd, commenting on one of these back-country homes, noted that it contained a dozen adults and children plus the household animals all "pigged lovingly together." Life on the frontier was long on mud, disease, and loneliness, short on the amenities. One historian has called the American frontier a slum with trees.<br><br>Despite local variations, women's activities were much the same throughout the colonies. First came supervision of the house. Women swept, scrubbed, laundered, polished. They made their own brooms, soap, polish. They carried water and did the laundry. They made starch. They ironed. They built fires and carried firewood. They made candles. They sewed everything--sheets, clothing, table linen, diapers. Women were usually in charge of the family bookkeeping. They ordered provisions, paid bills, and made sure the books were balanced.<br><br>It is virtually impossible for twentieth-century people to imagine the enormous job of food preparation in colonial times. Cooking was done on an open hearth that had to be tended constantly. Kettles, made of iron, often weighed forty pounds. Without refrigeration, meats had to be preserved by salting or pickling. <br><br>Rich and spicy sauces were the style, since they were needed to preserve food or to cover the taste of food that had been badly preserved. Women kept their own gardens, every fall putting up vast amounts of home-grown vegetables and fruit. They ran home bakeries and dairies, did the milking, made butter, and kept the hen yard.<br><br>Spinning and weaving cloth was another arduous job, involving more than a dozen operations from start to finish. Colonial women were also expected to be expert at knitting, quilting, and all sorts of sewing and embroidery. The following account, taken from the diary of a young colonial woman in 1775, indicates the emphasis placed on spinning, weaving, and needlecrafts. It also highlights the heavy work load colonial women took for granted.<br><br>Fixed gown for Prude . . . mended mothers riding hood, spun short thread . . . fix's two gowns for Welsh girls . . . carded, spun linen . . . worked on cheese basket . . . hatched flax with Hannah, we did 51 pounds a piece . . . pleated and ironed, . . . milked cows . . . spun linen . . . did 50 knots . . . made a broom of guineau wheat straw, spun thread to whiten . . . set a red dye, spun harness twine, scoured the pewter.<br><br>Colonial women also worked outside the home. In the villages, towns, and small cities of the eighteenth century they performed virtually every kind of job held by men. Women ran taverns, inns, and boarding houses. They were blacksmiths, silversmiths, wheelwrights, sailmakers, tailors, teachers, printers, newspaper publishers, and shopkeepers of every sort.Many women learned their trades from their husbands. A blacksmith, for example, would teach his wife the skill. If a tradeswoman was widowed, she frequently assumed the full responsibility for the business she had built with her husband. Many women acted as their husbands' business agents. Given the power of attorney by their mates, they were involved in all aspects of finance, including bringing debtors to court.That colonial women often participated in various sorts of legal proceedings is indicative of the colonial society's pragmatic approach toward women. Pre-Revolutionary Americans often bent the Common Law system (which in England largely excluded women) to suit their needs. Daniel Boorstin has explained this anomaly by noting that colonial America had no learned monopolies. Or, as William Byrd put it in a letter discussing the attractions of the New World, America was free from "Those three scourges of mankind--priests, lawyers and physicians." In the early days there were no bar associations or medical associations establishing proficiency requirements. In consequence, a woman with aptitude could learn a skill informally and practice a profession.<br><br>One of the most interesting women to lead a public life in colonial times was Margaret Brent, often referred to in seventeenth-century records as Mistress Margaret Brent, Spinster. Margaret, her sister Mary, and two brothers emigrated to Maryland from Great Britain in 1638. Lord Baltimore the proprietor of Maryland, attracted the Brents--who were wealthy Catholics--to his colony with promises of large land grants and the chance to live free of anti-Catholic discrimination.<br><br>The Brent sisters established their own plantations, which they ran without their brothers' help. In fact, Margaret Brent often acted as her brothers' representative and business adviser. Collecting payment in those days often involving suing in court. Records show Mistress Brent participating in 134 separate court actions during the eight years between 1642 and 1650. She usually won her case.<br><br>Brent's close personal friendship with Lord Calvert, Maryland's governor, eventually pushed her into the all-male world of politics. When Calvert lay dying in 1647, he called Brent to his bedside. In the presence of witnesses he made what has been called "perhaps the briefest will in the history of law": "I make you my sole executrix. Take all and pay all." As executrix, Brent assumed responsibility for Calvert's estates. Since Calvert had been granted the power of attorney for his brother, Lord Baltimore, the proprietor of Maryland, at Calvert's death the power of attorney for Lord Baltimore, then in London, fell to Mistress Brent.<br><br>At the time Maryland was not a peaceful colony. Calvert's enemies hoped to take advantage of the confusion following his death to seize control, and it seemed for a time that they might succeed. The man Calvert named to the governorship, Thomas Greene, was not equal to the job. After Calvert's death the army was close to revolt; Brent appeased the military by paying the soldiers their long-overdue wages, raising the necessary funds by selling some of Lord Baltimore's cattle. She took other steps as well to stabilize the situation in Maryland. Members of the Assembly later told Lord Baltimore that "all would have gone to ruin" were it not for her actions.<br><br>Brent had so far established herself as a major political figure that many in the colony believed that she, not Thomas Greene, ought to be governor. Brent, however, did not seek to unseat Greene. In January 1648 she appeared before the Maryland Assembly and asked for two votes: one as Calvert's executrix, the other as Lord Baltimore's "attorney." It was the first time in parliamentary history that a woman had sought political recognition in a governing body. Governor Greene refused to have Brent seated, and the Assembly acceded to his wishes.<br><br>Subsequently Brent left Maryland and moved to Virginia, where she established a new plantation, which she called Peace. She continued throughout her life to be active in business, but she avoided politics.<br><br>It seems probable that throughout most of the colonial period more women practiced medicine than did men. Women were nurses, apothecaries, unlicensed physicians, and midwives. Only surgery--which at that time meant performing amputations--was dominated by men. The kind of doctoring women did was often an extension of their work at home. A woman charged with the well-being of a family learned to care for the sick, to treat common illnesses, and to make the aged and the dying comfortable. A woman with particular skill in this area could earn money by caring not only for the members of her family but for others as well.<br><br>In the same way a woman who kept an herb garden and had an interest in botany could earn a living making medicines, tonics, and syrups. These women apothecaries varied in their level of sophistication. Though some lacked knowledge beyond folklore, many others were serious scientists who devoted much time to studying the healing properties of plants. Such skill was attested to by a French visitor to Virginia who wrote of Mary Byrd, "She takes great care of her Negroes . . . and serves them herself as a doctor in times of sickness. She had made some interesting discoveries of the disorders incident to them and discovered a very salutary method of treating a sort of putrid fever which carries them off."<br><br>There is evidence to indicate that the women who practiced medicine in the 1700s often did a better job than the male professionals of the 1800s. Medicine in the 1700s was very practical and down to earth. Doctoring women focused on relieving the patient's symptoms, while male doctors of the next century were far more concerned with expounding learned--though usually inaccurate--theories concerning the origin of the disease.<br><br>The efficacy of the eighteenth-century brand of care was seen in the practice of midwifery, which was the only form of medicine women participated in that was often licensed. Midwives had to serve lengthy apprenticeships before being certified. As apprentices they observed hundreds of deliveries and, for the most part, learned how to let nature take its course. Midwives seem to have taken good care of their female patients and most certainly did less harm than male doctors in the 1800s, many of whom routinely infected their patients with "puerperal sepsis" (childbed fever) by failing to wash their hands.<br><br>The women workers described so far were part of colonial America's pool of "free labor." As "free" workers, women had some control over their earnings and over the products of their work. Another sizable class of women workers in colonial America were not "free," however. These were the indentured servants and the slaves.<br><br>It is estimated that half the migrants to the colonies came under indenture, and that a third of these were women. Most of the women who came to the New World in this situation were convicts from Great Britain. Women thieves, prostitutes, and vagrants were given the choice of emigrating or of serving lengthy prison terms. Some...</p><h2>Adultery (Vintage International)</h2><p><p><i><b>I want to change.

There&#x2019;s something very wrong with this world, and it isn&#x2019;t just the wars going on in Asia or the Middle East.<br><br> Before I go to the newspaper, I have to interview Jacob, my ex-boyfriend from high school. Not even that cheers me up. I really am losing interest in things.<br><br> I LISTEN to facts about government policy that I didn&#x2019;t even want to know. I ask a few awkward questions, which he deftly dodges. He&#x2019;s a year younger than me, but he looks five years older. I keep this thought to myself. Of course, it&#x2019;s good to see him again, although he hasn&#x2019;t yet asked me what&#x2019;s happened in my life since we each went our own way after graduation. He&#x2019;s entirely focused on himself, his career, and his future, while I find myself staring foolishly back at the past as if I were still the adolescent who, despite the braces on my teeth, was the envy of all the other girls. After a while, I stop listening and go &nbsp;on autopilot. Always the same script, the same promises- reducing taxes, combating crime, keeping the French (the so-called cross-border workers who are taking jobs that Swiss workers could fill) out. Year after year, the issues are the same and the problems continue unresolved because no one really cares. After twenty minutes of conversation, I start to wonder if my lack of interest is due to my strange state of mind. No. There is nothing more tedious than interviewing politicians. It would have been better if I&#x2019;d been sent to cover some crime or another. Murderers are much more real.<br><br> Compared to representatives of the people anywhere else on the planet, ours are the least interesting and the most insipid. No one wants to know about their private lives. Only two things create a scandal here: corruption and drugs. Then it takes on gigantic proportions and gets wall-to-wall cover- age because there&#x2019;s absolutely nothing else of interest in the newspapers.<br><br> Does anyone care if they have lovers, go to brothels, or come out as gay? No. They continue doing what they were elected to do, and as long as they don&#x2019;t blow the national bud- get, we all live in peace.<br><br> The president of the country changes every year (yes, every year) and is chosen not by the people, but by the Federal Council, a body comprising seven ministers who serve as Switzerland&#x2019;s collective head of state. Every time I walk past the museum, I see endless posters calling for more plebiscites.<br><br> The Swiss love to make decisions&#x2014;the color of our trash bags (black came out on top), the right (or not) to carry arms (Switzerland has one of the highest gun-ownership rates in the world), the number of minarets that can be built in the country (four), and whether or not to provide asylum for expatriates (I haven&#x2019;t kept pace with this one, but I imagine the law was approved and is already in force).<br><br> &#x201c;Excuse me, sir.&#x201d;<br><br> We&#x2019;ve been interrupted once already. He politely asks his assistant to postpone his next appointment. My newspaper is the most important in French-speaking Switzerland and this interview could prove crucial for the upcoming elections.<br><br> He pretends to convince me and I pretend to believe him.<br><br> Then I get up, thank him, and say that I have all the mate- rial I need.<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need anything else?&#x201d; Of course I do, but it&#x2019;s not up to me to tell him what. &#x201c;How about getting together after work?&#x201d; I explain that I have to pick up my children from school, hoping that he sees the large gold wedding ring on my finger declaring: &#x201c;Look, the past is the past.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course. Well, maybe we can have lunch someday.&#x201d;<br><br> I agree. Easily deceived, I think: Who knows, maybe he does have something of importance to tell me, some state secret that will change the politics of the country and make the editor look at me with new eyes.<br><br> He goes over to the door, locks it, then comes back and kisses me. I return his kiss, because it&#x2019;s been a long time. Jacob, whom I may have once loved, is now a family man, married to a professor. And I am a family woman, married to a man who, though he inherited his wealth, is extremely hardworking.<br><br> I consider pushing him away and saying that we&#x2019;re not kids anymore, but I&#x2019;m enjoying it. Not only did I discover a new Japanese restaurant, I&#x2019;m having a bit of illicit fun as well. I&#x2019;ve managed to break the rules and the world hasn&#x2019;t caved in on me. I haven&#x2019;t felt this happy in a long time.<br><br> I feel better and better, braver, freer. Then I do something I&#x2019;ve dreamed of doing since I was in school.<br></p><h2>NIrV, Outreach Bible, Paperback, Blue</h2><p><p><strong>An affordable Bible that is easy-to-read and understand, and ideal for evangelism and outreach events for people of any age.</strong></p><p>This <em>NIrV Outreach Bible</em> is ideal for developing readers of all ages, and those learning English as a second language.

Shipwrecked and cast adrift, Lemuel Gulliver wakes to find himself on Lilliput, an island inhabited by little people, whose height makes their quarrels over fashion and fame seem ridiculous. His subsequent encounters - with the crude giants of Brobdingnag, the philosophical Houyhnhnms and brutish Yahoos - give Gulliver new, bitter insights into human behaviour. Swift's savage satire views mankind in a distorted hall of mirrors as a diminished, magnified and finally bestial species, presenting us with an uncompromising reflection of ourselves.</p><p>This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam. The notes, reading pointers, and vocabulary in this addition will also help students at a lower reading level get the most out of these classics."It is universally read, from the <br>cabinet council to the nursery," remarked Alexander Pope when Gulliver's Travels was published in 1726. One of the unique books of world literature, Swift's masterful satire describes the astonishing voyages of one Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon, to surreal kingdoms inhabited by miniature people and giants, quack philosophers and scientists, horses endowed with reason and men who behave like beasts. Written with great wit and invention, Gulliver's Travels is a savage parody on man and his institutions that has captivated readers for nearly three centuries.<br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with afford-<br>able hardbound editions of impor-<br>tant works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-<br>fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring<br>as its emblem the running torch-<br>bearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-<br>gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.&nbsp;&nbsp; As bestselling author and critic Allan Bloom observed: "Gulliver's Travels is an amazing rhetorical achievement. Swift had not only the judgment with which to arrive at a reasoned view of the world but the fancy by means of which he could re-create that world in a form which teaches where argument fails and which satisfies all while misleading none."</p><h2>Stan Lee&#39;s How to Write Comics: From the Legendary Co-Creator of Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, Fantastic Four, X-Men, and Iron Man</h2><p>Comics icon Stan Lee, creator of the Mighty Marvel Universe, has set about to teach everything he knows about writing and creating comic book characters.

Most important is the fact that it reveals the potential return of the Anunnaki in 2022, and the most frightening transformation that it would bring to the earth. If this is going to happen, a huge number of the people on earth, those grossly contaminated by Grays&#39; Dna, will be annihilated. Only those who are naturally uncontaminated and those who managed to clean themselves completely will be taken up through an antimatter bubble, with the animals and certain important buildings and inanimate art and culture objects, and kept safe until the earth would be clean again. Such a scenario is, to say the least, disconcerting. Even if you are not sure whether you are a believer or not, you should certainly consider the possibilities - and the book teaches you exactly how to save yourself.</p><p></p><h2>Homosexuality and the Christian: A Guide for Parents, Pastors, and Friends</h2><p>Honest, accurate answers to questions about homosexuality from the leading Christian expert on the topic.

Yarhouse is a professor of psychology and the director of the Institute for the Study of Sexual Identity at Regent University.

Dr. Yarhouse received his PsyD from Wheaton College and has worked collaboratively on a number of books. He and his family live in Virginia Beach, Virginia.Yarhouse challenges the church to provide an alternative script, one that makes identity in Christ central, and therefore carefully distinguishes between temptation, behavior, and the center of one&#39;s identity. By taking into consideration those with same-sex attraction who nevertheless reject the gay identity, Yarhouse shifts the conversation from the causes of homosexuality to the choices one makes regarding the will of God. --Christianity Today</p><h2>Frameworks for Internal Medicine</h2><p>Introducing an innovative, systematic approach to understanding differential diagnosis, Frameworks for Internal Medicine helps students and other learners think like clinicians and master the methodology behind diagnosing the most commonly encountered conditions in internal medicine.<br><br> This highly visual resource uses a case-based, Q&amp;A-style format to build frameworks that guide learners through each step in the differential diagnosis process.

If you have always wanted to pursue a creative dream, have always wanted to play and create with words or paints, this book will gently get you started and help you learn all kinds of paying-attention techniques; and that, after all, is what being an artist is all about. It&#x2019;s about learning to pay attention.&#x201d;<br><b>--Anne Lamott, Mademoiselle</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The premise of the book is that creativity and spirituality are the same thing, they come from the same place. And we were created to use this life to express our individuality, and that over the course of a lifetime that gets beaten out of us. [<b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b>] helped me put aside my fear and not worry about whether the record would be commercial.&#x201d;<br><b>--Grammy award-winning singer Kathy Mattea</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Julia Cameron brings creativity and spirituality together with the same kind of step-by-step wisdom that Edgar Cayce encouraged.

Behind his British reserve, tides of grief, rage, and loneliness surge&#x2015;but what is revealed is a man who loves being alive despite all the everyday injustices.</p><p>When Christopher Isherwood's <i>A Single Man </i>first appeared, it shocked many with its frank, sympathetic, and moving portrayal of a gay man in maturity. Isherwood's favorite of his own novels, it now stands as a classic lyric meditation on life as an outsider.</p></p><p><b>Christopher Isherwood</b> (1904-1986) was born in Manchester, England, and lived in Berlin from 1929 to 1933 and immigrated to the United States in 1939. A major figure in twentieth-century fiction and the gay rights movement, he wrote more than twenty books. FSG Classics presents some of his finest work, including the novels <i>Prater Violet</i>, <i>A Single Man</i>, and <i>A Meeting by the River</i>; the semi-autobiographical <i>Lions and Shadows</i>; and the memoir <i>Christopher and His Kind</i>.Isherwood's resurrected classic&#x2014;now a feature film&#x2014;takes us to Southern California in the 1960s and into one day in the life of George, a gay, middle-aged English professor, struggling to cope with his young lover's tragic death. Simon Prebble's voice is a perfect conduit for Isherwood's lyricism, and he assumes the role of George so naturally and with such raw feeling that listeners will feel as if they are hearing the words straight from the protagonist himself, so beautifully does Prebble create George's reserve behind which surge tides of grief, rage, and bitter loneliness. <i>A University of Minnesota paperback.

In his Meditations of 1641, and in the Objections and Replies that were included with the original publication, he set out to dismantle and then reconstruct the idea of the individual self and its existence. In doing so, Descartes developed a language of subjectivity that has lasted to this day, and he also took his first steps towards the view that would eventually be expressed in the epigram Cogito, ergo sum ("I think, therefore I am"), one of modern philosophy's most famous&#x2014;and most fiercely contested&#x2014;claims.

CLARKE<p>Of all the works of the man claimed by many as the father of modern philosophy, the Meditations (1641), must surely be Rene Descartes' masterpiece.</p><p>The six Meditations and accompanying selections from the Objections and Replies provide a definitive statement of what Descartes intended as the foundations of his whole philosophy. His project was to resolve the epistemological questions brought about by the prevailing scepticism of his age; to build, from the basis of self-awareness (Cogito, ergo sum), through the notion of a benevolent God, to a systematic and novel approach to metaphysics, and to construct a secure starting-point for science.</p><p>The first part of a new two-volume edition of the works of Descartes in Penguin Classics, this volume consists not only of a new translation of the original Latin text and extensive selections from the Objections and Replies, but also includes relevant correspondence from the period 1643-49, Part One of The Principles of Philosophy and Comments On a Certain Manifesto, as examples of Descartes' other metaphysical writings from the period 1641-49.</p><b>Rene Descartes</b> (1596-1650), French philosopher and mathematician, is generally regarded as the founder of modern philosophy. <br><br><b>Desmond Clarke</b> is professor of philosophy at University College, Cork.</p><h2>The Book of Orchids: A Life-Size Guide to Six Hundred Species from around the World</h2><p>One in every seven flowering plants on earth is an orchid. Yet orchids retain an air of exotic mystery&#x2014;and they remain remarkably misunderstood and underappreciated. The orchid family contains an astonishing array of colors, forms, and smells that captivate growers from all walks of life across the globe. Though undeniably elegant, the popular moth orchid&#x2014;a grocery store standard&#x2014;is a bland stand-in when compared with its thousands of more complex and fascinating brethren, such as the Demon Queller, which grows in dark forests where its lovely blooms are believed to chase evil forces away. There is the Fetid Sun-God, an orchid that lures female flies to lay their eggs on its flowers by emitting a scent of rancid cheese. Or the rare, delicate Lizard Orchid, which mimics the appearance of lizards but smells distinctly of goat.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>The Book of Orchids</i> revels in the diversity and oddity of these beguiling plants. Six hundred of the world&#x2019;s most intriguing orchids are displayed, along with life-size photographs that capture botanical detail, as well as information about distribution, peak flowering period, and each species&#x2019; unique attributes, both natural and cultural. With over 28,000 known species&#x2014;and more being discovered each year&#x2014;the orchid family is arguably the largest and most geographically widespread of the flowering plant families.

The North Korean army invades South Korea, intent on uniting the country under Communist rule. In response, the United States mobilizes a force to defend the overmatched South Korean troops, and together they drive the North Koreans back to their border with China.<br><br> But several hundred thousand Chinese troops have entered Korea, laying massive traps for the Allies. In November 1950, the Chinese spring those traps. Allied forces, already battling stunningly cold weather, find themselves caught completely off guard as the Chinese advance around the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea. A force that once stood on the precipice of victory now finds itself on the brink of annihilation. Assured by General Douglas MacArthur that they would be home by Christmas, the soldiers and Marines fight for their lives against the most brutal weather conditions imaginable&#x2014;and an enemy that outnumbers them more than six to one.<br><br> <i>The Frozen Hours</i> tells the story of Frozen Chosin from multiple points of view: Oliver P.

He&#x2019;ll be in the thick of it.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur seemed to speak to all of them, but Smith had to respond.<br><br>&#x201c;His men went in at Blue Beach, sir. He&#x2019;ll be at his new command post there, certainly.&#x201d; He glanced to one side, saw Ned Almond hanging on Mac�Arthur&#x2019;s words like a sparrow on a telephone wire, a hint of anger toward Smith. Smith tried to avoid Almond&#x2019;s glare, turned to Mac�Arthur again. &#x201c;The jeeps are waiting. On your command, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s go. We delay any longer, this thing might be over before we get to see it.&#x201d;<br><br>The aides behind Mac�Arthur laughed, his ever-�present audience, Almond laughing the loudest. Smith moved to the door of the crude hut, held out one hand.<br><br>&#x201c;This way, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith backed away from the opening, allowed Mac�Arthur the lead, a tradition Smith had learned from their first meeting in Tokyo, a month before. He kept back, allowed the other staff officers to go as well, Almond first, the man ignoring Smith as much as he could. Smith shook his head, then stopped, clamped down any reaction at all, wouldn&#x2019;t show any of them a response. The aides flowed past, the room emptying quickly. He glanced at Craig.<br><br>General Edward Craig was, by title, the assistant commander of the Marine division, and so Smith&#x2019;s second in command, a combat veteran whom Smith respected enormously.<br><br>Craig said nothing, and Smith glanced at the simple accommodations Craig had established, Smith&#x2019;s folding cot in one corner, the field desk where Craig had spread the all-�important maps. Smith reached for his helmet, said, &#x201c;I suppose I&#x2019;m off on a field trip, General. Mac wants to see the action. He&#x2019;s asking for the right man.&#x201d;<br><br>Craig nodded, a quick smile. &#x201c;Not sure why General Mac�Arthur seems drawn to Colonel Puller.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith shrugged. &#x201c;He likes fighters. They go back to the last war. Lewie had a few choice comments about Mac, but Mac doesn&#x2019;t seem to mind. Or he doesn&#x2019;t listen to anything a Marine has to say.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or he&#x2019;s going to arrest him. Just on general principles.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith looked down.<br><br>&#x201c;Then you can have his job.&#x201d; It was a joke, but neither man was laughing. &#x201c;Got to go, Eddie. Can&#x2019;t keep the man waiting.&#x201d;<br><br>He moved outside, saw the others loading up into the jeeps, four vehicles summoned for the journey. There was space remaining in one, directly behind Mac�Arthur, who sat beside a Marine driver who could not avoid a wide-�eyed sideways stare. Smith climbed up, wedged his long legs in tightly, looked at the others around them, Almond in one front seat, the others filled now with staff officers and the reporters who had come along with Mac�Arthur. Smith knew the routine, Mac�Arthur handpicking his favorites for the privilege of accompanying the commanding general to the front lines of his great triumph. The Marine drivers all seemed transfixed by Mac�Arthur, but it was Smith who gave the order, a quick wave of his hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Move out!&#x201d;<br><br>The jeeps rolled into single file, Smith shifting his weight, trying to maneuver his legs into some kind of comfortable position. Mac�Arthur turned slightly, said, &#x201c;Puller, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir. As I said, we&#x2019;re headed to Blue Beach, Colonel Puller&#x2019;s forward command post. He&#x2019;ll be there, certainly.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur nodded, seemed satisfied, stared forward, the jeep lurching past scattered shell craters, the remnants of the navy&#x2019;s bombardment. Smith couldn&#x2019;t avoid the questions in his mind, sliding between the stabs of discomfort in his legs. Was this all it took? The big guns from the ships unload on them, and the North Koreans just . . . take off? It&#x2019;s never that easy. No, surely they&#x2019;re still out there. Not sure how many. Puller will know more about that. But we&#x2019;re in range of just about any kind of artillery right here, and maybe mortars, too. Mac�Arthur must know that, of course. But if I told him that, offered him caution, he&#x2019;d just order the driver to go faster, closer. Well, it&#x2019;s his show.<br><br>They passed ambulances, other trucks small and large, artillery moving into position. Smith kept his eyes on a long ridgeline in front of them, thick smoke in bursts, spreading out with a light breeze. The thumps from distant artillery came in a steady rumble, the impacts on the ridge mostly from enemy mortars. Smith studied the hill carefully, men in motion, his men, but there was little else to see, the smoke spreading in a wide thin blanket. Up ahead, he saw officers gathering near the road, pointing toward the jeeps. Smith held his hand up, instinct, a message to the driver behind him. He reached a hand out to his own driver, tapped him on the shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;Pull over here.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man eased the jeep to the side of the road, the officers approaching, a pair of cautious MPs among them. They seemed baffled by the strange convoy, but there was recognition, eyes wide, more men emerging from wrecked huts, all of them coming closer. Mac�Arthur seemed to absorb that, gave the men time to assemble. Mac�Arthur glanced toward a reporter&#x2019;s upraised camera, rose slowly, stood high in the jeep, leaned heavily on the windshield, made a slow wave to the gathering Marines. Smith kept his place, knew to wait for Mac�Arthur to leave the jeep. Finally, Mac�Arthur stepped off, and Smith was surprised to see him stumble slightly, a hint of unsteadiness. An aide was beside Mac�Arthur quickly, seemed prepared, but Mac�Arthur held him away with his hand. The man backed off, Mac�Arthur fully in control now, hands on his hips, the ever-�present pipe in his mouth. He seemed to pose for a long minute, the camera clicking away. Smith jumped down, no reporter aiming any camera at him. He stumbled himself, a nagging pain in his knees, held himself against the jeep. One of the men moved closer, a captain Smith recognized, Puller&#x2019;s aide. Mac�Arthur said, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Puller?&#x201d;<br><br>The captain looked briefly at Smith, then pointed behind him. &#x201c;Up on that ridge, sir. There&#x2019;s a good many of the enemy . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur said, &#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s get up that ridge.&#x201d; He turned to Smith. &#x201c;I thought this was his command post.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is, sir.&#x201d; Smith looked again at the smoke, a new round of shelling peppering the crest. &#x201c;I might suggest waiting for Colonel Puller to return.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur was already stepping out onto the road, moving toward the ridge. The others fell into line quickly, Mac�Arthur leading the parade at a brisk walk, Smith catching up, keeping the pace. He watched Mac�Arthur carefully, could feel the pace slowing, Mac�Arthur not hiding the weariness in his legs. The ridge was steep and dusty, the smoke drifting past, and Mac�Arthur slowed even more, a hint of a struggle. Smith watched as Almond moved past in a rush, taking his place beside his commanding general.<br><br>The road narrowed, more shell craters on all sides, rocks strewn about, the wreckage of a jeep partially blocking the way. Smith looked into the jeep as they passed, nothing but charred metal, and he thought of protesting again, but Mac�Arthur stared ahead, slow, plodding pace, saying nothing. Smith glanced back, the line of reporters and aides strung out down the hill, men with pads of paper, more cameras. He knew he couldn&#x2019;t allow this ridiculous parade to just wander out onto the open crest of an exposed hill. The incoming mortar fire came again, down to one side, and Smith said, &#x201c;Sir, we should stop here. Colonel Puller is certainly close by.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur took one more slow step, then halted, seemed to fight for air, Almond beside him, pretending not to notice. Mac�Arthur straightened, eyed the crest of the hill just ahead, said, &#x201c;I want Puller. Find him.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith glanced around, saw Marines working mortars of their own, a heavy machine gun dug into a cluster of rocks, one man with field glasses pointing the way, the gunner firing a long burst. More men seemed to emerge from the rugged ground, all of them recognizing Mac�Arthur. Smith felt the need to grab the man and pull him back down the hill, the thought in his brain: This is no place for you.<br><br>And then, the booming voice of Chesty Puller. &#x201c;What in blazes we got here? Oh, for the love of Gertrude. They told me it was you coming up here. You&#x2019;re the only man who&#x2019;d lead a damn caravan to the front lines.&#x201d; The salute came now, hard and crisp, Puller&#x2019;s chest puffed out even farther than usual. &#x201c;General Mac�Arthur, it is my honor. Welcome, sir.&#x201d; He looked past Almond at Smith now, a hard scowl giving way to the hint of a smile. &#x201c;You too, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith needed nothing further from Puller, knew there would rarely be formalities between them. He knew that Mac�Arthur had an odd affection for Puller, despite the fact that Puller seemed to bristle at nearly every order Mac�Arthur had ever given him. The thought rolled into Smith&#x2019;s head. Nobody but Lewie would talk to Mac like that and expect to keep his command. Puller knows something we don&#x2019;t. Or, Mac thinks he does.<br><br>Smith had known Lewis Puller since their early days at Fort Benning, through several campaigns in the Pacific. The two men were complete opposites in appearance, Puller barely five six, with a thick barrel chest that rode precariously upon two birdlike legs. Smith towered over him, a lean frame standing better than six feet. Their temperament seemed radically opposite as well, Puller a profane and caustic man. But Smith had seen the softer side of Puller, knew him to be a man of enormous heart, and if Puller&#x2019;s first instinct was to jam his Marines into anyplace hot, it wasn&#x2019;t because he was careless with their lives. Puller had absolute confidence that his Marines could do anything he asked of them, and do it well. If men died, well, it&#x2019;s war. That&#x2019;s what men did. But Smith knew that Puller never glossed over his casualties, even if the newspapers portrayed him as the hardhearted and sometimes hardheaded warrior. Smith knew another side of Puller almost no one ever saw, what few newspapermen would find worth writing about. Chesty Puller was extremely well-�read, a man who took education seriously. Smith knew they were far more alike than people assumed. No matter Puller&#x2019;s flaws or rough edges, Smith truly liked the man. And clearly, Mac�Arthur did, too.<br><br>Mac�Arthur scanned the area, then said, &#x201c;We thought we&#x2019;d find you at your command post, Colonel.&#x201d;<br><br>Puller stabbed a pipe into his teeth. &#x201c;This is my command post, General. There&#x2019;s a hell of a scrap down that hill.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur studied the distant ridges, smoke billowing up nearby, more incoming mortar fire. Smith closed his eyes, shook his head, saw Puller watching him. You know what I&#x2019;m thinking, Lewie. This is insanity.<br><br>Mac�Arthur said, &#x201c;Colonel, your regiment is splendid. First-�rate. I am gratified to present you with a Silver Star.&#x201d; Mac�Arthur seemed to rummage through his pockets, then shrugged. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t seem to have one handy. Well, my staff will make note of it. So, where&#x2019;s the enemy?&#x201d;<br><br>Puller pointed behind, back to the next ridge. &#x201c;The sons of bitches are right over there, General. There&#x2019;s no doubt some North Korean officer is up there pointing to all these sons of bitches right here.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith flinched, but Mac�Arthur didn&#x2019;t react. His aides came closer, binoculars put into Mac�Arthur&#x2019;s hands. He raised them, scanned for a moment, said, &#x201c;Seoul is how far?&#x201d;<br><br>Puller said, &#x201c;Four miles, maybe more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How long before you get there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Three or four days.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur lowered the glasses, glanced back at Smith. &#x201c;I thought we were pushing them more quickly. We should be inside the city now.&#x201d;<br><br>Smith had no answer, knew the timetable had been bested already, wasn&#x2019;t sure why Mac�Arthur or anyone else would complain. Puller said, &#x201c;Sir, there&#x2019;s a good bunch of those other fellows out there. We pushed &#x2019;em back to these ridges, and figured they&#x2019;d keep going, blow outta here pretty quick. But they&#x2019;ve reinforced. Seems like they intend to make a fight out of this. But we&#x2019;ll get there, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur handed the binoculars to an aide. &#x201c;I wish they&#x2019;d come on up here and give us a fight. We&#x2019;d clean them out pronto. I want that city by the twenty-�fifth. You understand that, Colonel?&#x201d;<br><br>Puller took a deep breath, looked at Smith. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll do our best, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Mac�Arthur stared out again, his hands planted firmly on his hips. The smoke rose from a new round of incoming fire, the artillery behind them responding, sharp whistles passing overhead.<br><br>&#x201c;Magnificent. You Marines have done the job. I told them back on the ship, the admiral, the reporters. The Marines and navy have never shown more brightly. They&#x2019;ll quote me on that. The world will know. I want a Presidential Unit Citation for these boys.&#x201d; He turned, looked past Smith to the reporters, who had kept their distance. &#x201c;You hear that? Write it down.&#x201d; Mac�Arthur looked again at Puller, kept his hands on his hips, and Smith could feel Mac�Arthur&#x2019;s pride, the raw satisfaction. To one side, a mortar blast drove the reporters back, a nervous flock of birds, the Marines around them ducking low as well. Another blast came now, farther away, then more, patterned along the crest of the ridge. Smith kept his position, close behind Mac�Arthur, Almond glancing nervously at Smith. He felt the words coming in his head, wouldn&#x2019;t say anything out loud. These are the front lines, General Almond. Get used to it.<br><br>Puller stared out through binoculars of his own, called now for a radioman. He turned to Mac�Arthur, said, &#x201c;Excuse me, General, but I&#x2019;ve got some things that require my attention. You want us in Seoul, we need to clean things up out here first.&#x201d; Smith knew Puller&#x2019;s mood, that it was time to go to work. Parades could come later.<br><br>After a long moment, Mac�Arthur said, &#x201c;Excellent job, Colonel. Truly well done.&#x201d; He turned, Almond following in step, both men moving past Smith. But Mac�Arthur stopped, looked again at Puller. &#x201c;No more delays, Colonel. I want Seoul in hand on the twenty-�fifth.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Cache of Jewels: And Other Collective Nouns (World of Language)</h2><p>"Highly informative and lushly illustrated.

Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."PreSchool-Grade 1 ``A muster of peacocks,'' ``a kindle of kittens,'' and other familiar and unusual collective nouns form the text of Heller's book. Bright, richly-colored oil pencil and line drawings enliven each set of objects, and some are exceptionally life-likeone can practically hear the crunch of the crusty loaves of bread and smell the bananas. Each group of items is presented in rhyme, which is remarkably smooth and unforced until the last page, when an explanation of the concept of col lective nouns, more suited to simple prose, intrudes. While ``. . .Jewels'' can be used to help children learn about parts of speech, its principal charm lies in the illustrations and the vocabulary itself, which will delight small eyes and ears.

What, as a country, do we owe them? Cris Beam, a foster mother herself, spent five years immersed in the world of foster care looking into these questions and tracing firsthand stories.

Why did you write this book?</strong></p> <p>A. I&#x2019;m a foster mother and, through my other books and reporting, I&#x2019;ve spent a lot of time with people impacted by the child welfare system. I was amazed that we could spend more than 20 billion dollars a year in this country on a system that nobody&#x2014;not the foster kids, not the foster or biological parents, not the social workers, not the administrators or commissioners&#x2014;thinks is working. I wanted to find out why.</p> <p><strong>Q. You adopted your foster daughter, Christina, when she was kicked out of her group home at age 17. Christina is 30 now. What is she up to these days? What is your relationship with her like?</strong></p> <p>A. Christina is an adult and she&#x2019;s pretty amazing. She lives in Los Angeles doing HIV outreach and education and goes to college at night. We&#x2019;re very close, we talk on the phone every other day or so. I feel so lucky, really, to have her in my life.</p> <p><strong>Q. You interviewed dozens of children, birth parents, foster parents, agency workers, and others in your five years of research. They all must have changed you in some way, but were there a few who especially stuck with you?</strong></p> <p>A. I spent several years tracking a set of parents in Brooklyn, Bruce and Allyson Green, who were particularly loving and dedicated. They did everything right: they took advantage of all the educational and extracurricular resources available to their foster kids, they loved their foster and biological kids equally, and when the time came, they adopted a girl named Fatimah and had done everything but sign the adoption papers with a girl named Dominique. Both of these girls were 17. Adoption is like the Holy Grail in foster care. In this case though, Fatimah and Dominique panicked. For so long, adoption had been held out as a kind of panacea to all of their prior trauma, and when adoption didn&#x2019;t fix their lives, they ran away, and ended up worse than before.</p> <p>I also followed a single mom in Yonkers named Mary who adopted much older kids, kids who had already aged out of the system and were technically adults. These kids also fell outside the fixed lens of child welfare, but they were helped tremendously by adoption. Sometimes the most creative solutions aren&#x2019;t happening within child welfare itself, but just at its edges.</p> <p><strong>Q. In what ways is the state of foster care in New York City reflective of the state of systems around the country? In what ways is it different?</strong></p> <p>A. New York&#x2019;s child welfare system is an enormous, overburdened bureaucracy with a thousand moving parts, all with different allegiances and poor intercommunication. It&#x2019;s this bureaucracy, rather than one bad director or singular mal intent, which is so destructive. You&#x2019;ll see this Kafka-esque quality everywhere. Also, as with our jails and prisons, child welfare is becoming increasingly privatized&#x2014;in New York and across the country&#x2014;and this has both useful, and problematic, implications. As far as foster care implementation, New York is somewhere in the middle: there are cities and states with far higher caseloads or longer delays to family reunification, and there are places that do a better job.</p> <p><strong>Q. About how many children are in foster care in the U.S. this year?</strong></p> <p>A. The last data we have is from July 2012, and there were 400,540 kids in foster care. The numbers have gone down significantly in the last 15 years, thanks to the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act, but the numbers have also changed. We&#x2019;re seeing the youngest kids getting adopted, but more teenagers than ever are aging out of the system with no resources at all.</p> <p><strong>Q. Are there any numbers on what percentage of kids in foster care are eventually adopted?</strong></p> <p>A. It's important to remember that the central goal of foster care is to reunite kids with their birth parents, and in any given year about half of the kids will go home. The trouble is really with the trauma they endure during the separation, shuffling their way through multiple strangers' homes&#x2014;on average, for close to two years.</p> <p>There are biological parents who can&#x2019;t or won&#x2019;t care for their children, though, and last year about 50,000 foster kids were adopted from foster care and 100,000 foster kids were waiting for prospective parents. On average, the adopted kids had been in foster care for three years and then waited another year to be adopted. But these are averages: some kids will wait much longer, or never be adopted at all. And these figures don&#x2019;t even include the tens of thousands of kids 16 and older who have given up hope for adoption entirely, deciding to just wait for emancipation from the system as adults.</p> <p><strong>Q. Why don&#x2019;t we hear more about these kids?</strong></p> <p>A. For one, people are afraid to read about child abuse. It&#x2019;s painful and frightening to think about kids being harmed. In reality, though, the vast majority of kids are removed from their families not for abuse but for neglect&#x2014;and many argue that &#x201c;neglect&#x201d; is a code word for &#x201c;poor.&#x201d; We can look at poverty with a more direct gaze, so this may be a way to open the conversation more.</p> <p>Secondly, there&#x2019;s a kind of fait accompli attitude around foster care and foster kids in general; we don&#x2019;t see it as the dynamic, changeable, and changing system that it really is. </p> <p><strong>Q. Since 2006, Florida&#x2019;s foster care system has been funded differently from other states&#x2019;. Their system was recognized as a possible model for other states by President Obama in 2011. What makes Florida unusual? Should other states adopt their way?</strong></p> <p>Traditionally, and in most states, foster care is funded on a per diem basis: agencies get a certain dollar amount from the federal and state government for every day a child stays in a foster or group home. This financial structure provides a kind of perverse incentive to remove kids from their parents. In 2006, Florida accepted a flat fee, called a waiver, for five years. This meant they only had to remove kids from the most dangerous households and then could spend the rest of the money on things like abuse prevention, drug rehabilitation, and keeping the family stable and secure. Thirty states and counties have now applied for similar waivers, promising a sea change in the way we think about, and approach, child welfare overall. I think it&#x2019;s quite promising and exciting.</p><p>HMH&nbsp;hardcover, 2013, previous ISBN 978-0-15-101412-5</p></p><h2>Inventor Ninja: A Children&#39;s Book About Creativity and Where Ideas Come From (Ninja Life Hacks)</h2><p><p><b>Inventor Ninja was used to creating and problem-solving.

The book concludes with an informational note from Montalv�n that explains more about his disabilities and how much freedom Tuesday has given him. He also talks briefly about the organization that trained Tuesday. A well-written, informative book for both school and public libraries.&#x2014;Susan E.

With a fresh and easy-to-follow approach to cartooning, Christopher Hart shows readers basic tips for creating a cast of the most hilarious, outrageous characters inspired by today's cartoons. Chock-full of tips, hints, and step-by-step illustrations, Modern Cartooning gives artists of all ages the tools they need to let their imaginations run wild.</p><p><p>CHRISTOPHER HART is the world's bestselling author of drawing and cartooning books.

Renowned for up-to-the-minute content and easy-to-follow steps, all of Hart's books have become staples for a new generation of aspiring artists and professionals, and they have been selected by the American Library Association for special notice.</p><p>"First, let&#x2019;s examine the various theories of cartooning from a contextual standpoint. Oh, what the heck, let&#x2019;s just start drawing! <br> You may be wondering if it&#x2019;s possible to create cartoons with personality by beginning at a basic level. You foolish, foolish mortal. You&#x2019;re only half right. The faces you&#x2019;re going to begin with are easy to draw, but they&#x2019;re also pro-level character designs that are highly entertaining and stuffed with personality. You can achieve these results by using a few simple head shapes and filling them with simplified facial features. But there&#x2019;s more to it than that: The initial construction of the head shape (in this case, a circle) should remain <i>conspicuous</i> even in the final character design. This technique causes the head shape to appear as an obvious feature of your cartoon character. The basic head construction does not just serve as a guideline for the finished drawing; it becomes a caricature of a &#x201c;regular&#x201d; head.

She hadn&#x2019;t paused earlier tonight in using her beauty to lead the unsuspecting man from the tavern to his fate, while Jana had hesitated far too long before her sharp blade finally found its mark in his heart.</p><p>Sabina was strong, passionate, and completely fearless. Heart in throat as she followed Sabina inside, Jana wished she could be more like her older sister. But she&#x2019;d always been the careful one. The planner. The one who&#x2019;d seen the signs in the stars because she&#x2019;d studied the night skies all her life.</p><p>The prophesied child had been born and she was here in this large and luxurious villa&#x2014;built of sturdy stone and wood compared to the small, poorer straw and mud cottages in the village nearby.</p><p>Jana was certain this was the right place.</p><p>She was knowledge. Sabina was action. Together they were unstoppable</p><p>Sabina cried out as she turned the corner of the hallway up ahead. Jana quickened her pace, her heart pounding. In the dark hallway, lit only by wall-set torches that flickered their meager light on the stone walls, a guard had her sister by her throat.</p><p>Jana didn&#x2019;t think. She acted.</p><p>Thrusting out her hands, she summoned air magic. The guard lost his grip and flew back from Sabina, slamming into the wall behind her hard enough to crush his bones. He crumpled to the ground in a heap.</p><p>Sharp pain sliced through Jana&#x2019;s head, agonizing enough to make her whimper. She wiped at the warm, thick blood that now gushed from under her nose. Her hand trembled.</p><p>Sabina gingerly touched her injured throat. &#x201c;Thank you, sister.&#x201d;</p><p>This fresh blood magic helped speed their steps and clear their vision in the darkness of the unfamiliar, narrow stone hallways. But it wouldn&#x2019;t last long.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d; Sabina demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Close.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trusting you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The child is here. I know she is.&#x201d; They proceeded a few steps more down the dark hallway.</p><p>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d; Jana stopped outside an unlocked door.</p><p>She pushed it open and the sisters moved toward the ornately carved wooden cradle inside the room. They looked down at the baby, swaddled in a soft rabbit&#x2019;s fur coverlet. Her skin was pale white with a healthy, rosy glow to her chubby cheeks.</p><p>Jana adored her instantly. The first smile she&#x2019;d been capable of for days blossomed on her face. &#x201c;Beautiful girl,&#x201d; she whispered, reaching into the cradle to gently pick up the newborn.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re certain it&#x2019;s her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; More than anything else in her seventeen years of life, Jana was positive of this. The child she held in her arms, this small, beautiful baby with sky-blue eyes and a fuzz of hair that would one day be black as a raven&#x2019;s wing, was the one prophesied to possess the magic necessary to find the Kindred&#x2014;four objects that contained the source of all <i>elementia</i>, elemental magic. Earth and water, fire and air.</p><p>The child&#x2019;s magic would be that of a sorceress, not a common witch like Jana and her sister. The first in a thousand years, since Eva herself had lived and breathed. There would be no need for blood or death to play any part in this child&#x2019;s magic.</p><p>Jana had seen her birth in the stars. Finding this child was her destiny.</p><p>&#x201c;Put my daughter down,&#x201d; a voice snarled from the shadows. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hurt her.&#x201d;</p><p>Jana spun around, clutching the infant to her chest. Her eyes fell on the dagger the woman pointed toward them. Its sharp edge glinted in the candlelight. Her heart sank. This was the moment she&#x2019;d been dreading, had prayed wouldn&#x2019;t come to pass.</p><p>Sabina&#x2019;s eyes flashed. &#x201c;Hurt her? That&#x2019;s not what we plan to do at all. You don&#x2019;t even know what she is, do you?&#x201d;</p><p>The woman&#x2019;s brows drew together with confusion, but fury hardened her gaze. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll kill you before I allow you to leave this room with her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No&#x201d;&#x2014;Sabina raised her hands&#x2014;&#x201c;you won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>The mother&#x2019;s eyes grew wide and her mouth opened, gasping. She couldn&#x2019;t breathe&#x2014;Sabina was blocking the flow of air to her lungs. Jana turned away, face screwed up in misery. It was over in a moment. The woman&#x2019;s body fell to the ground, still twitching but lifeless, as the sisters sidestepped her and fled the room.</p><p>Jana gathered her loose cloak around the baby to hide her as they left the villa and ran into the forest. Sabina&#x2019;s nose bled profusely now from using so much destructive magic. Blood dripped to the snow-covered ground.</p><p>&#x201c;Too much,&#x201d; Jana whispered as their steps finally slowed. &#x201c;Too much death tonight. I hate it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She wouldn&#x2019;t have let us take her any other way. Let me see her.&#x201d;</p><p>Feeling oddly reluctant, Jana held the baby out.</p><p>Sabina took her and studied the child&#x2019;s face in the darkness. Her gaze flicked to Jana and she gave her sister a wicked grin. &#x201c;We did it.&#x201d;</p><p>Jana felt a sudden rush of excitement, despite the difficulties they&#x2019;d faced. &#x201c;We did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were incredible. I wish I could have visions like you do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only with great effort and sacrifice can I have them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all a great effort and sacrifice.&#x201d; Sabina&#x2019;s voice twisted with sudden disdain. &#x201c;Too much of it. But for this child, one day magic will be so easy. I envy her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll raise her together. We&#x2019;ll tutor her and be there for her and when the time comes for her to fulfill her destiny, we&#x2019;ll stand by her side every step of the way.&#x201d;</p><p>Sabina shook her head. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ll take her from here.&#x201d;</p><p>Jana frowned. &#x201c;What? Sabina, I thought we agreed to make all decisions together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not this one. I have other plans for the child.&#x201d; Her expression hardened. &#x201c;And apologies, sister, but they don&#x2019;t include you.&#x201d;</p><p>Staring into Sabina&#x2019;s suddenly cold eyes, Jana at first didn&#x2019;t feel the sharp tip of the dagger sink into her chest. She gasped as the pain began to penetrate.</p><p>They&#x2019;d shared every day, every dream&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;every secret.</p><p>However, it would appear, not <i>every</i> secret. This was not something Jana would have ever thought to try to foresee.</p><p>&#x201c;Why would you betray me like this?&#x201d; she managed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my <i>sister</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Sabina wiped away the blood that still trickled from her nose. &#x201c;For love.&#x201d;</p><p>When she yanked out the blade, Jana collapsed to her knees on the frozen ground.</p><p>Without a backward glance, Sabina swiftly walked away with the child and was soon swallowed by the dark forest.</p><p>Jana&#x2019;s vision dimmed and her heart slowed. She watched as the hawk she&#x2019;d seen earlier flew away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;leaving her to die alone.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>PAELSIA</p><p>SIXTEEN YEARS LATER</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Alife without wine and beauty isn&#x2019;t worth living. Don&#x2019;t you agree, princess?&#x201d; Aron slung his arm around Cleo&#x2019;s shoulders as the group of four walked along the dusty, rocky country path.</p><p>They&#x2019;d been in port for less than two hours and he was already drunk, a fact not unduly startling when it came to Aron.</p><p>Cleo&#x2019;s glance fell on their accompanying palace guard. His eyes flashed with displeasure at Aron&#x2019;s proximity to the princess of Auranos. But the guard&#x2019;s concern wasn&#x2019;t necessary. Despite the fancy jeweled dagger Aron always wore on a sheath hanging from his belt, he was no more dangerous than a butterfly. A drunk butterfly.</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t agree more,&#x201d; she said, lying only a little.</p><p>&#x201c;Are we almost there?&#x201d; Mira asked. The beautiful girl with long, dark, reddish hair and smooth, flawless skin was both Cleo&#x2019;s friend and her older sister&#x2019;s lady-in-waiting. When Emilia decided to stay home due to a sudden headache, she&#x2019;d insisted that Mira accompany Cleo on this trip. Once the ship arrived in the harbor, a dozen of their friends chose to remain comfortably on board while Cleo and Mira joined Aron on his journey to a nearby village to find the &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; bottle of wine. The palace wine cellars were stocked with thousands of bottles of wine from both Auranos and Paelsia, but Aron had heard of a particular vineyard whose output was supposedly unparalleled. At his request, Cleo booked one of her father&#x2019;s ships and invited many of their friends on the trip to Paelsia expressly in search of his ideal bottle</p><p>&#x201c;That would be a question for Aron. He&#x2019;s the one leading this particular quest.&#x201d; Cleo drew her fur-lined velvet cloak closer to block out the chill of the day. While the ground was clear, a few light snowflakes drifted across their rock-strewn path. Paelsia was farther north than Auranos, but the temperature here surprised her nonetheless. Auranos was warm and temperate, even in the bleakest winter months, with rolling green hills, sturdy olive trees, and acres upon acres of rich, temperate farmland. Paelsia, by contrast, seemed dusty and gray as far as the eye could see.</p><p>&#x201c;Almost there?&#x201d; Aron repeated. &#x201c;Almost there? Mira, my peach, all good things come to those who wait. Remember that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My lord, I&#x2019;m the most patient person I know. But my feet hurt.&#x201d; She tempered the complaint with a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beautiful day and I&#x2019;m lucky enough to be accompanied by two gorgeous girls. We must give thanks to the goddess for the splendor we&#x2019;ve been greeted with here.&#x201d;</p><p>Watching the guard, Cleo saw him briefly roll his eyes. When he noticed that she had seen him, he didn&#x2019;t immediately look away as any other guard might. He held her gaze with a defiance that intrigued her. She realized she hadn&#x2019;t seen&#x2014;or, at least, noticed&#x2014;this guard before today.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; she addressed him.</p><p>&#x201c;Theon Ranus, your highness.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, Theon, do you have anything to add to our discussion about how far we&#x2019;ve walked this afternoon?&#x201d;</p><p>Aron chortled and swigged from his flask.</p><p>&#x201c;No, princess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised, since you are the one who&#x2019;ll be required to carry the cases of wine back to the ship.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my duty and honor to serve you.&#x201d;</p><p>Cleo considered him for a moment. His hair was the color of dark bronze, his skin tanned and unlined. He looked as if he could be one of her rich friends waiting on the ship rather than a uniformed guard her father had insisted accompany them on this journey.</p><p>Aron must have been thinking the exact same thing. &#x201c;You look young for a palace guard.&#x201d; His words slurred together drunkenly as he regarded Theon with a squint. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be much older than I am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m eighteen, my lord.&#x201d;</p><p>Aron snorted. &#x201c;I stand corrected. You are much older than me. Vastly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By one year,&#x201d; Cleo reminded him.</p><p>&#x201c;A year can be a blissful eternity.&#x201d; Aron grinned. &#x201c;I plan to cling to my youth and lack of responsibility for the year I have left.&#x201d;</p><p>Cleo ignored Aron, for the guard&#x2019;s name now rang a bell in her mind. She&#x2019;d overheard her father as he exited one of his council meetings briefly discuss the Ranus family. Theon&#x2019;s father had died only a week ago&#x2014;thrown from a horse. His neck had broken instantly.</p><p>&#x201c;My sympathies for the loss of your father,&#x201d; she said with sincerity. &#x201c;Simon Ranus was well respected as my father&#x2019;s personal bodyguard.&#x201d;</p><p>Theon nodded stiffly. &#x201c;It was a job he did with great pride. And one I hope to have the honor to be considered for when King Corvin chooses his replacement.&#x201d; Theon&#x2019;s brows drew together as if he hadn&#x2019;t expected her to know of his father&#x2019;s death. An edge of grief slid behind his dark eyes. &#x201c;Thank you for your kind words, your highness.&#x201d;</p><p>Aron audibly snorted and Cleo shot him a withering look.</p><p>&#x201c;Was he a good father?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;The very best. He taught me everything I know from the moment I could hold a sword.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded sympathetically. &#x201c;Then his knowledge will continue to live on through you.&#x201d;</p><p>Now that the young guard&#x2019;s dark good looks had caught her attention, she found it increasingly difficult to return her gaze to Aron, whose slight frame and pale skin spoke of a life spent indoors. Theon&#x2019;s shoulders were broad, his arms and chest muscled, and he filled out the dark blue palace guard uniform better than she ever would have imagined possible.</p><p>Guiltily, she forced herself to return her attention to her friends. &#x201c;Aron, you have another half hour before we head back to the ship. We&#x2019;re keeping the others waiting.&#x201d;</p><p>Auranians loved a good party, but they weren&#x2019;t known for their endless patience. However, since they&#x2019;d been brought to the Paelsian docks by her father&#x2019;s ship, they&#x2019;d have to keep waiting until Cleo was ready to leave.</p><p>&#x201c;The market we&#x2019;re going to is up ahead,&#x201d; Aron said, gesturing. Cleo and Mira looked and saw a cluster of wooden stalls and colorful worn tents, perhaps another ten minutes&#x2019; walk. It was the first sign of people they had seen since they&#x2019;d passed a ragged band of children clustered around a fire an hour ago. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll soon see it was well worth the trip.&#x201d;</p><p>Paelsian wine was said to be a drink worthy of the goddess. Delicious, smooth, without equal in any other land, its effects did not lead to illness or headaches the next day, no matter how much was consumed. Some said that there was strong earth magic at work in the Paelsian soil and in the grapes themselves to make them so perfect in a land that held so many other imperfections.</p><p>Cleo wasn&#x2019;t planning to sample it. She didn&#x2019;t drink wine anymore&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t for many months. Before that, she&#x2019;d consumed more than her share of Auranian wine, which didn&#x2019;t taste much better than vinegar. But people&#x2014;at least, Cleo&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t drink it for the taste; they drank it for the intoxicating results, the feeling of not a care in the world. Such a feeling, without an anchor to hold one close to shore, could lead one to drift into dangerous territory. And Cleo wasn&#x2019;t in any hurry to sip anything stronger than water or peach ...</p></p><h2>The Night Voyage: A Magical Adventure and Coloring Book (Time Adult Coloring Books)</h2><p><b>This third adult coloring book in Daria Song's Time series follows the little girl on a new nighttime adventure when the conductor of her toy train comes to life and helps her distribute gifts across the world.</b><br><br><i>The Night Voyage </i>is an evocatively illustrated story of a little girl who is swept away on the eve of her birthday by her toy train conductor on a magical journey to distribute gifts around the globe.

His warm-hearted, challenging (and surprisingly witty) book takes readers through the the five points of Calvinism, revealing that a true understanding has a humbling effect on our hearts, fueling a love of Christ and his people that builds others up, rather than tearing them down. <br><br> This book is both a helpful summary of what Calvinism is, and a helpful challenge to those who are convinced Calvinists. It calls them to hold Calvinism in their hearts, not just in their heads, so that they are humble and gracious as well as zealous for the truth, to the praise and glory of Christ and his church.</p><p>J.A. Medders is Lead Pastor of Redeemer Church, Tomball, Texas. He&#39;s also an author and blogger and is married to Natalie, with two children.If you're not a Calvinist, this book is for you; and if you are a Calvinist, this book is for you. Jeff Medders explains simply, winsomely, and humbly from a Calvinistic perspective what the Bible teaches about five key doctrines. And he demonstrates throughout that no one truly understands the "doctrines of grace" unless they themselves are gracious and humble. Down-to-earth, often funny, and with a keen knack for illustration, Medders makes plain what biblical Calvinism Humble Calvinism looks like in everyday life. --Donald S. Whitney, Author, Praying the Bible; Professor of Biblical Spirituality and Associate Dean, SBTS, Louisville<br><br>Reformed culture seems to be known for its harshness and lack of grace. Yet Reformed soteriology should create a joyful heart and a deep, glad humility that overflows into compassionate evangelism and graciousness to all. I hope Jeff's book will be used by God to renew a spirit of gentleness and humility among us, and will encourage those who have rejected these beautiful beliefs to consider them anew. --Matt Chandler, Lead Pastor, The Village Church, Dallas; President, Acts 29; author, Take Heart<br><br>Maybe in another generation the term "humble Calvinism" won't seem like such an oxymoron. If so, this encouraging and challenging book will have been used by God to help us live up to what we believe. --Collin Hansen, Editorial Director, The Gospel Coalition; author, Young, Restless, and Reformed and Blind Spots</p><h2>The Sooner the Better (Deliverance Company)</h2><p><b>She's stuck with Jack...&nbsp;</b><br><br>Lorraine Dancy has just discovered that everything she believes about her father is a lie&#x2014;starting with the fact that Thomas supposedly died years ago.

Lorraine Dancy closed her eyes as the first shovelful of dirt hit her mother's casket. The sound seemed to reverberate around her, magnified a hundred times, drowning out the words intoned by Father Darien. This was her mother&#x2014; her <em>mother</em>&#x2014;and Virginia Dancy deserved so much more than a cold blanket of Kentucky mud.<br><br>Lorraine had received word the evening of April first that her mother had been involved in a horrible freeway accident. In the beginning she'd thought it was some kind of cruel hoax, a distasteful practical joke, but the mud-splattered casket was real enough to rip her heart wide open.<br><br>Her chest tightened with the effort to hold back tears. A low mewling escaped her lips and her trembling increased as she listened to the priest's words in the gray afternoon.<br><br>After a while, the friends who'd come to say their last farewells started to move away. Father Darien gently took hold of Lorraine's hands and in sincere compassionate tones offered a few final words of comfort. Reaching deep within herself, Lorraine managed to thank him.<br><br>Still, she remained, standing by her mother's grave.<br><br>"Sweetheart." Gary Franklin, her fiance, stepped closer and placed his arm around her waist. "It's time to go home."<br><br>She resisted and held her ground when Gary tried to steer her toward the waiting limo. She wasn't ready to leave her mother. Not yet. Please, not yet. It made everything so final...to turn her back and walk away.<br><br>This shouldn't be happening. This couldn't be real. But the reality of the moment was undeniable&#x2014;the open grave, the nearby headstones, the muddy ground. Her fears assailed her from all sides, sending a chill down her spine. Lorraine wasn't sure she could survive without her mother's love and support. Virginia had been her touchstone. Her example. Her <em>mother.</em><br><br>"Sweetheart, I know this is difficult, but you can't stay here." Gary again tried to urge her away from the grave.<br><br>"No," she said, her voice stronger now. What made it all the more difficult, all the more painful, was the complete lack of warning. Lorraine had talked to her mother that very weekend. They were so close; it had been the two of them against the world for as long as Lorraine could remember. Not a day passed that they didn't connect in some way&#x2014;with a conversation, a visit, an email message. On Saturday they'd spent more than an hour on the phone discussing plans for the wedding.<br><br>Her mother had been delighted when Lorraine accepted Gary's proposal. Virginia had always liked Gary and encouraged the relationship from the beginning. Gary and her mother had gotten along famously.<br><br>Just last weekend&#x2014;just a few days ago&#x2014;her mother had been alive. During their phone call Virginia had chatted endlessly about the kind of wedding she wanted for her only child. They'd discussed the wedding dress, the bridesmaids, the flowers, the invitations. Lorraine had never heard her mother sound more excited. In her enthusiasm, Virginia had even mentioned her own wedding all those years ago and the only man she'd ever loved. She rarely spoke of Lorraine's father. That was the one thing she didn't share with her daughter&#x2014;at least not since Lorraine's early teens. Those were private memories, and it was as though Virginia held them close to her heart. They'd sustained her through the long lonely years of widowhood.<br><br>Lorraine couldn't remember her father, who'd died when she was three. Her mother had loved Thomas Dancy so completely she'd never entertained the thought of remarrying. No man, she'd once told Lorraine, could live up to the memory of the one she'd lost.<br><br>Her parents' love story was possibly the most romantic Lorraine had ever heard. When she was small, her mother had often told her how wonderful Thomas had been. In later years, of course, she hardly ever talked about him, but Lorraine remembered those long-ago stories&#x2014;of her father being a decorated war hero and how her parents had defied everyone by getting married. They were the adventure tales, the marvelous bedtime stories of her early childhood, and they'd made a deep and lasting impression on her. It was one of the reasons Lorraine had waited until she was twenty-eight before becoming engaged herself. For years she'd been searching for a man like her father, a man who was noble. Honest. Brave. A man of integrity and high ideals. No one seemed right until Gary Franklin came into her life.<br><br>"Lorraine, everyone's gone." Gary's arm tightened around her waist.<br><br>"Not yet. Please." She couldn't leave her mother, not like this. Not in a cold wet grave when Virginia Dancy hadn't even reached the age of fifty. The pain was more than Lorraine could bear. As the agony of the moment overwhelmed her, tears began to roll down her cheeks.<br><br>"Come on, honey, let me get you away from here," Gary murmured in a compassionate voice.<br><br>Lorraine took a step in retreat. She didn't want Gary. She didn't want anyone except her mother. And her mother was in a grave. "Oh, Mom," she cried, then broke into sobs, unable to stop herself.<br><br>Gary turned her in his arms and held her protectively against him. "Let it out, sweetheart. It's okay. Go ahead and cry."<br><br>Lorraine hid her face in his shoulder and wept as she hadn't since that night the state patrolman had come to her with the tragic news. How long Gary let her weep, she didn't know. Until her eyes stung and her nose ran and there were no more tears to shed.<br><br>"The house is going to fill up and you'll need to be there," Gary reminded her.<br><br>"Yes, we should go," she agreed, and wiped her nose with the tissue he handed her, grateful that Virginia's neighbor, Mrs. Henshaw, would be there to let everyone in. Lorraine was calmer now, more self-possessed. People would want to talk about her mother, and since Lorraine was the only one left in the family, she'd have to be in control of her emotions.<br><br>Together she and Gary started toward the parking lot. Away from her mother. Away from the only parent she'd ever known.<br><br>Lorraine's one, small comfort was the knowledge that after twenty-five years apart, her parents were finally together again.<br><br>Lorraine couldn't sleep, but then she hadn't really expected to. She should be exhausted. She <em>was </em>exhausted; she'd barely slept in days. This past week had been the most emotionally draining of her life. But even now, after the funeral and the wake, she was too restless to collapse into sleep.<br><br>Gary seemed to think that spending the night at her mother's house wasn't the best idea. He was probably right. Her judgment, along with everything else, had been thrown off-kilter by her mother's death.<br><br>The wake had been here, at Virginia's place, since Lorraine's apartment was much too small to host the event, and a restaurant seemed too impersonal. Parishioners from St. John's Church where Virginia had faithfully attended Mass all these years, plus a large group of neighbors, coworkers and friends, had lingered to tell Lorraine how sorry they were. They, too, appeared to have difficulty accepting the suddenness of her mother's death.<br><br>Virginia had been an active member of St. John's and a devout Catholic. For twenty years she sang in the choir and worked tirelessly for her church "family." As a stockbroker with a large national firm, she'd made a name for herself in the business world. Turnover at the firm was high, and Virginia had learned that office friendships were often fleeting. Nevertheless, the house had been crammed with people.<br><br>Contrary to what Lorraine had assumed, she wasn't needed as hostess. Friends and neighbors arrived bearing casseroles, breads and salads, which soon covered the dining-room table. The extras spilled into the kitchen and lined the countertops.<br><br>Lorraine was grateful to everyone, especially Gary who'd been both helpful and kind. Yet throughout the wake, all Lorraine had wanted was to be alone, to grieve by herself without people pressing in on her. But that wasn't possible. It took her a while to realize that the friends who'd come were in need of solace, too. So she'd thanked them for their condolences and done her best to take on the role of comforter. Before long, she'd found herself depleted of energy, and she'd sunk into her mother's favorite chair. Sitting there helped her feel closer to the mother she'd loved so deeply. It eased the ache of loneliness that threatened to consume her in a room full of people.<br><br>An endless stream of sympathy and advice had come at her.<br><br>"Of course you'll want to keep the house..."<br><br>Lorraine had nodded.<br><br>"Naturally you'll be selling the house..."<br><br>Lorraine had nodded.<br><br>"Your mother was a fine woman."<br><br>"We're all going to miss her."<br><br>"She's in a happier place now..."<br><br>".such a senseless tragedy."<br><br>Lorraine had agreed with one and all.<br><br>By the time everyone had left, it was dark. Gary had helped her with the cleanup and urged her to return to her own apartment. Or to his. He didn't seem to understand her need to stay here, but how could he? He'd never lost a parent.<br><br>"You should go on home," she'd told him. "I'll be fine."<br><br>"Darling, you shouldn't be alone. Not tonight."<br><br>"It's what I want," she'd insisted, yearning for him to leave. It was an unfamiliar feeling, and one she didn't fully comprehend. She loved Gary, planned to spend the rest of her life with him, but at that moment she'd wanted him out the door. She had to deal with her grief and pain in her own way.<br><br>"You need me," Gary told her with loving concern.<br><br>"I do," she said. "Just not right now."<br><br>Disappointment registered in his deep brown eyes and he nodded with obvious reluctance. "You'll phone if you change your mind?"<br><br>Lorraine had said she would.<br><br>He'd kissed her on the forehead in a sweet gesture of love and consolation. Shivering with the evening's cold, Lorraine had stood out on the porch and watched him drive off.<br><br>She'd cleared away the dishes, then wandered aimlessly through the house, pausing in the entrance to each room. Tenderly she caressed the things that had once been her mother's most prized possessions. She closed her eyes and pictured her mother and father together at last and the wonderful reunion they must be enjoying.<br><br>Lorraine was comforted by the knowledge that Virginia had been happy during the last weeks of her life. She'd been thrilled at the news of her daughter's engagement, thrilled at the prospect of planning a large formal wedding. No sooner had Lorraine said yes to Gary's proposal than Virginia had started making elaborate plans for the October wedding. She'd valued tradition and frowned on Lorraine's having chosen a small emerald necklace in lieu of the usual engagement ring.<br><br>"You have your wish now, Mom," she said aloud. The wedding ring on her left hand had belonged to her mother. The inside of the band was engraved with the words "I'll love you always. Thomas." The funeral director had given it to her that very day, just before he'd closed the casket. Lorraine had slipped it on and wouldn't remove it until the time came for her own wedding. Her mother had worn this ring since the day Thomas Dancy placed it on her finger, and now Lorraine would wear it, too.<br><br>"What am I going to do without you, Mom?" Lorraine said into the stillness of the night, her eyes welling with tears. It surprised her that she had any left.<br><br>She mulled over everything she'd done that had been a disappointment to her mother. She'd dropped out of medical school after her second year and trained as a nurse-practitioner, instead. Virginia had said little, but Lorraine knew her mother regretted that decision. She liked to think she'd made up for it when she met Gary, who sold medical supplies to Group Wellness, where Lorraine worked.<br><br>The fact that she'd become a lapsed Catholic had distressed her mother, as well, but Lorraine had never identified with the church the way Virginia had. She attended a nondenominational Christian church, but her mother would have preferred she remain Catholic.<br><br>"I'm so sorry, Mom," she whispered, knowing she'd let her mother down in countless other ways.<br><br>When she'd finished her emotional journey through the house, Lorraine had taken a hot shower and changed into a nightgown, one she'd bought Virginia the previous Christmas. After giving the matter some thought, she'd chosen to sleep in her mother's room, rather than her own. When she was frightened as a child, she'd always climbed into her mother's bed. Lorraine was frightened now, afraid of the future, afraid to be without Virginia, without family.<br><br>As she lay there sleepless, she gathered her memories around her, finding consolation in the happiness they'd experienced. Day-to-day life had been full of shared pleasures, like cooking elaborate meals together, watching the classic movies they both loved, exchanging favorite books. Virginia also worked for several church-sponsored charities, and Lorraine sometimes spent an evening helping her pack up boxes of food for needy families, or stuffing envelopes. Her mother had been a wonderful woman, and Lorraine was proud of her. She'd been devout in her faith, hardworking, kindhearted. Smart, but generous, too.<br><br>After an hour or so, Lorraine gave up even trying to sleep. She sat up and reached for the framed photograph of her parents, which rested on the nightstand. The picture showed Virginia as young and beautiful, wearing a full, ankle-length dress with a wreath of wildflowers on her head. Her long straight hair fell nearly to her waist. She held a small bouquet of wildflowers in one hand; with the other hand she clasped her husband's. Her eyes had been bright with happiness as she smiled directly into the camera.<br><br>The Thomas Dancy in the picture was tall and bearded, and wore his hair tied in a ponytail. He gazed at his bride with an identical look of love and promise. Anyone who saw the photograph could tell that the two of them had been deeply in love.<br><br>As recently as last weekend, when they'd been discussing Lorraine's wedding plans, she'd teased her mother about the photo, calling her parents "flower children." Virginia had been good-natured about it and merely said, "That was a long time ago."<br><br>Sadly this photograph was the only one Lorraine had of her parents together. Everything else had been destroyed in a fire when she was in grade school. Lorraine remembered the fire, not realizing until years later all that she'd lost. Her parents' photographs and letters, her father's medals.<br><br>Lorraine knew that Virginia O'Malley had met Thomas Dancy her freshman year in college and they'd quickly fallen in love. The war in Vietnam had separated them when her father volunteered for the army in 1970. He'd survived the war and come home a hero. It was a year later, during a routine physical, that something unusual had shown up in his blood work. That something had turned out to be leukemia. Within six months, Thomas was dead and Virginia was a young widow with a child.<br><br></p><h2>Teach Writing Well: How to Assess Writing, Invigorate Instruction, and Rethink Revision</h2><p>Ask successful writers and they&#x2019;ll tell you, the key to writing well is revision.

Faison, along with two partners, was an urban prince with cars, jewels, and people -- in awe of this million-dollar phenomenon -- at his feet. His legacy has been praised by hip-hop's top names in their lyrics, and his life was the basis for the urban cult classic film <i>Paid in Full</i> starring Mekhi Phifer, Wood Harris, and rapper Cam'ron and produced by Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Films. <br> <br> In <i>Game Over</i>, Azie brings forth a powerful memoir of New York's perilous drug underworld and music industry, with an intellect and wisdom to empower and challenge the street culture he knows so very well.</p><p>Azie Faison is a former drug lord turned anti-drug advocate.

Open the fuckin' safe now, or I'm gonna kill everybody in this bitch! Hurry up, motherfucka..." That's the last thing he said before he hit me hard in the head with the butt of his gun, causing blood to flow into my eyes. Shaking with fear and numb from the pain, I tried to respond: "Look, man...The blood is blinding me. I can't see! I don't have no money in the safe anyway. Just let everybody go...I'll get you some money. They don't got nothin' to do with this."</p><p>I was on my knees, bent over, with blood pouring out of my head. I felt no pain; I was numb. This was my judgment day -- payment for all my sins. God lost patience with me. Instead of listening, I ignored the Lord's warnings and turned my back on Him. I heard His voice throughout the years, but I wasn't sure it was Him. So there I was. My head was spinning, my heart was pounding, and my eyes were stinging from the sticky blood pouring into them.</p><p>Stumbling around in pain, I managed to clear some blood from my eyes using my shirt. What I saw took my breath away: Five people, including my aunt and my best friend, were tied up in my aunt's bedroom. They were handcuffed and lying facedown, pleading for their lives. By nightfall, my aunt, her friend, and my best friend were pronounced dead. Two more people survived, but they sustained serious wounds. As for me, I took two shots to my head at point-blank range, and seven more: one to my neck, another in my shoulder, and the rest in my leg. I was shot nine times. I saw a bright light and my body felt like it was rising toward the light.</p><p>"We're losing him, we're losing him. He won't make it." The paramedics who rushed me to the hospital had no reason to believe I'd survive. In fact, I didn't survive...at least the old me didn't. On that day, the old me was killed so a new me could be reborn.</p><p>People who lived in New York City, especially Harlem, during the eighties and nineties regard me as a street legend. I made millions before I was old enough to vote, which allowed me to live a life most people only dream of living. Customized cars, fine women, property, and street respect were my way of life. I spent money at will and made it possible for many people in Harlem to eat and pay bills. Along with my associates, Rich Porter and "Alpo," I had no way of knowing that years down the road, our lifestyles would influence music, clothing, and even Hollywood.</p><p>How did I get so much money and influence at such a young age? I was a hustler...<i>yeah, I sold drugs.</i> I did my thing during the Pablo Escobar-Manuel Noriega-Oliver North era. Throughout the eighties and nineties, I probably sold enough cocaine to make it snow in New York City.</p><p>But anything built on negativity will eventually bring destruction to those who profit from it. In the end, we all paid a huge price for the fame and wealth we got by selling drugs. The drug game forced me to experience things that changed my life forever.</p><p>I was born in a Bronx hospital on November 10, 1964. I lived the first six years of my life between 165th and 167th Streets and Clay Avenue. We lived in a poor neighborhood, and like many other families on the block, we received public assistance, or welfare.</p><p>Many people like to say, "Even though we were poor, I never knew we were poor." I think people say that to show respect to their parents for trying to make ends meet. My parents did the best they could, given our situation. Poverty, like wealth, is something that is both hard to hide and hard to deny. I couldn't escape the reality that my family was poor. Everything from where we lived to how we lived, reminded us we were poor.</p><p>I had seven brothers and sisters: Wanda was the oldest, then came Kevin, Robin, Rosalyn (also known as "Pie"), me, Julie, Ingrid, and Wayne. Out of my sisters, Robin was my favorite because she knew how to mind her business and she knew plenty of street cats who made big money growing up.</p><p>I'll never forget when Wanda ran away from home to be with her boyfriend at the time. She returned months later...and she was pregnant! My mother greeted her with open arms. I guess she was just happy to have her firstborn back home.</p><p>My little sister Ingrid was my little baby girl. I was proud of her because she graduated from A. Phillip Randolph High School, located on the City College campus, and eventually did a year of college. By Ingrid's senior year in high school, I told her that when she graduated I would buy her a car. I was about twenty-one years old at the time, and I kept my promise.</p><p>My brother Kevin graduated from John F. Kennedy High School, and entered the United States Marine Corps. He only stayed for a couple of months before he received a dishonorable discharge. I believe it had something to do with him smoking weed.</p><p>Wayne was the baby of the family, and like most babies, he was spoiled. He never wanted for anything. When I got into the game and had major money, I bought Wayne and my nephew hot dirt bikes one Christmas. They became the envy of the block, since most kids barely had regular bikes at the time.</p><p>My sister Pie was something else. At Stitt Junior High, she won the beauty pageant, which made her and me very popular in the school. Julie was always very quiet and reserved. She stayed to herself or under my mother.</p><p>Things were so tight back then that nine of us lived in a one-bedroom apartment. My parents occupied the bedroom, and we slept in the living room on a pullout couch or the floor.</p><p>To be fair, we took turns sleeping on the couch. Everyone hated the floor because you usually woke up with a permanent crick in your neck and a sore back. On the nights I had the floor, I used pillows to cushion myself. It wasn't comfortable, but we didn't have a choice so we made the best of it. Poverty robs you of options.</p><p>Poverty also influences your decisions. For example, not having much money actually motivated us to attend school every day (although we didn't always <i>stay</i> in school all day). We appreciated school not just for the lessons, or the friendships we made, but because it provided us with two hot meals daily. We all went to school early to get breakfast, and <i>never</i> missed lunch. Dinner was the only meal we had at home during the week, and usually this consisted of a bologna or ham sandwich and some juice or milk.</p><p>My mother, Margaret Rogers, was a native New Yorker. She met my father when she was twenty years old; he was forty. I figure she wanted to get with an older man who could provide her with a good quality of life.</p><p>Short, fair-skinned, and heavyset, my mother was a housewife who wanted to enjoy life's finer things, having grown up poor herself. Unfortunately, my father's salary could not support her desires. As a result, she constantly reminded my father of how broke we were.</p><p>My mother was always a great cook. She made huge feasts for the holidays, and we couldn't wait to get our hands on her apple cobbler and smothered turkey wings. I liked everything she cooked with the exception of chitlins -- the entire house smelled like shit whenever she prepared them. She believed everyone had the right to eat and eat well. In fact, people would often knock on our door, and my mother would make them plates with no hesitation.</p><p>My father, Azie Faison, Sr., was born and raised in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He stood about five feet nine and wasn't very large, but he carried himself like a giant. He was dark-skinned with strong, proud facial features. He had jet-black hair like a Native American and honest, penetrating eyes that looked right through you.</p><p>My mother taught me the importance of making money. My father, on the other hand, taught me how to be a man. He wasn't just a man; he was the man. He was the most humble and reliable person I've ever known. He moved furniture for a living so he didn't make a lot of money. But he worked hard to support our household. Unlike many men at the time, he didn't smoke, drink, gamble, chase women, or maintain a fancy wardrobe.</p><p>My father didn't try to be something he wasn't and he didn't change for anybody. I remember times my mother would have some girlfriends over at the house, laughing and gossiping. My father would sit quietly in his chair watching television. Once they left, my father would mutter, "Thank God. Now I can relax and have my space." Privacy and humility were important to him. I never remember anyone saying a bad word about him.</p><p>When I got involved with the drug game, my father was the only family member who didn't ask me for money or presents. He told me he "wanted nothing to do with my blood money."</p><p>It wasn't until I began selling coke, around 1983, that I had huge knots of cash. I felt like I was the man because I brought in more money in a week than my father did in a year. Cocaine sales made me the main breadwinner in the house. I paid the rent, bought food and items for the apartment, and gave my mother rolls of money whenever she needed it. I figured that since I took care of the home, nobody could tell me shit.</p><p>And it seemed like everybody in the house respected my authority -- everybody except my father. My money didn't mean shit to him. He refused my money and demanded my mother do the same (although my mom had no problems accepting it when he wasn't around). As far as he was concerned, he was the man of the house, and still had the authority to regulate his children. He proved that one day when he came into my room and caught me bagging up some coke. I had shit everywhere: a huge mound of coke, baggies, a scale, and hundreds of little vials.</p><p>"What's this? What are you doing in my house?" he asked. "You get involved with those drugs and you're gonna pay," he warned. "And if you are selling that poison, I don't want nothing to do with you until you stop."</p><p>I ignored every word and didn't even reply. In my ignorance (and arrogance) I shut him down and shrugged him off. That was the turning point in our relationship. For the first time, I didn't yield to his authority. He shook his head in disappointment and left. True to his word, he stopped speaking to me from that day unt...</p></p><h2>Tongue Tied: Untangling Communication in Sex, Kink, and Relationships</h2><p><p>You can't get what you unless you ask for it!</p><p>"My favorite thing when I'm working with clients is when their eyes go wide with the 'ah-ha' moment that they really can have the sex life of their dreams.

My parents were both professors at the University of North Carolina: my mom is a classicist (which means she knows everything you could ever imagine about myths, Latin, and words) and my dad teaches Shakespeare (which means I&#x2019;d seen&nbsp; <i>As You Like It</i>&nbsp;about five times by the age of 18.) I have one brother, who is a musician and lives in California with his son and his wife, an artist who designed my personal website. (Thanks, Mariangeles!) <br> <br> "I&#x2019;ve been writing, in one way or another, for as long as I can remember. I was always a big reader, mostly because my parents were. I used to get frustrated with my mom because she bought me books for Christmas when what I really wanted were the gifts my friends got, things like sweaters and jewelry. But I did love to read. When I was eight or nine my parents gave me an old manual typewriter and a little desk in the corner of our den, and I&#x2019;d sit there and type up my stories. I was the kind of kid that people always sighed over and said, "She has such a wild imagination," which usually meant "I wish Sarah would try to stick to the truth." I have a tendency to embellish: I think it&#x2019;s just a weakness of fiction writers. Once you learn how to make a story better, it&#x2019;s hard not to do it all the time. <br> <br> "In high school, I was lucky enough to have a big group of girlfriends that have really inspired a lot of the stories in my books. I&#x2019;m still close with my friends from that time, so it&#x2019;s never very hard to put myself back into that place, that voice. Also it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to still be living in my hometown, where it&#x2019;s a given that I&#x2019;ll bump into people I had homeroom with, or guys I had big crushes on, while I&#x2019;m pumping gas or buying stamps. It makes it hard to leave high school behind entirely, which is a good or bad thing depending on what day you ask me. I attended college at UNC, where I studied creative writing and graduated with a degree in English. (Which means I can quote small parts of many Great Works. Comes in handy occasionally, like at cocktail parties.) I&#x2019;d been on the five-and-a-half year college plan, and when I graduated my parents were hoping I&#x2019;d settle down and get a Real Job so they could stop worrying about me. But instead of doing the whole resume/pantyhose thing, I decided to stick to my job waiting tables at the world famous Flying Burrito Restaurant and try to publish a novel. At the time, I had only one very bad book I&#x2019;d written my senior year of college and the beginnings of another one. Luckily, my family was supportive and I spent a few years living in a ramshackle little house where I wrote during the day and did the restaurant thing at night. <br> <br> "Three years after graduating, I sold my first book,&nbsp; <b>That Summer</b>, but it wasn&#x2019;t until a year after that that I got offered a teaching job and left waitressing for good. I still miss it sometimes, though. It was a great job for a writer. Endless conversations to eavesdrop, tons of material, and fast money without ever taking work home. Plus, free Mexican food, the best perk of all. Now, I&#x2019;ve published four books, all for young adults. I never really intended to be YA writer, but the second book I showed my agent she thought had a strong teenage voice, so she sent it off to an editor at Orchard Books, who bought it. Even though it was in a way accidental, I&#x2019;ve found that writing for teens suits me. I do short stories, and other novels, that are for an older audience, but again and again I am brought back to the stories of high school. Maybe it&#x2019;s because so much happened to me then that I&#x2019;m not finished yet telling everything. My senior quote was from Pink Floyd (okay, I was a bit of a burnout---I spent a lot of time in the parking lot, whatever, let&#x2019;s move on) and it pretty much summed up my future, although I didn&#x2019;t know it at the time. It was: "The time is gone, the song is over, thought I&#x2019;d something more to say." It turns out that I did. <br> <br> "The books I read when I was teenager, the good ones anyway, have stuck more in my mind than anything since. I still love books, but while I couldn&#x2019;t tell you complete plots of novels I read even six months ago, I do remember even the smallest descriptive details from Lois Lowry&#x2019;s&nbsp; <b>A Summer to Die</b>&nbsp;or Judy Blume&#x2019;s&nbsp; <b>Are You There God? It&#x2019;s Me, Margaret</b>. I think it was because back then books were still somewhat new to me, and when I found an author who seemed to say just what I was feeling, it really struck me and resonated. I hope that my books do that for the people who read them: I think it&#x2019;s the best thing to which any writer can aspire. Now, I teach writing at UNC-Chapel Hill, where I&#x2019;m lucky enough to see my students find their own voice, the way I did in the same program there not so long ago. Teaching is great for me, because I get to show people how writing can really change the way you see not only yourself but the world. I&#x2019;ve found in my own life that if my writing isn&#x2019;t going well, not much else will. It is the one constant, the key to everything else. <br> <br> "As far as my other life, my non-writing life, I live in the country with my husband, some lizards, and two dogs who are completely spoiled and rule me completely. I like to work in my garden---although I have not yet perfected the art of keeping everything alive----and, in my weaker moments, shop. I have a bit of an addiction to the Gap clearance rack, to be honest. I have this strange need to buy huge quantities of black pants. How many pairs of black pants does one person need? (Obviously for me, the answer is 11 and counting. But I digress.) What else can I tell you? I love Starbucks mochas but they make me way hyper. I subscribe to too many magazines. I make a mean bean salad. I could go on, but the truth is, my books are much more exciting than I am, and that&#x2019;s a good thing. It&#x2019;s always more fun to make stuff up anyway." <br><b>Sarah Dessen</b>&nbsp;is the author of thirteen novels, which include the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers&nbsp;<i>The Moon and More</i>,&nbsp;<i>What Happened to Goodbye</i>,&nbsp;<i>Along for the Ride</i>,&nbsp;<i>Lock and Key</i>,&nbsp;<i>Just Listen</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Truth About Forever</i>, and&nbsp;<i>This Lullaby</i>.
